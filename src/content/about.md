# About this space

Hello! I’m [Alessandro](https://alessandro.codes), and Colliding Fractals is my digital garden.

This is where I [[Ideas need to be grappled with|grapple with]] ideas that fascinate me to refine, crystallize, and eventually turn them into more polished artifacts. You’ll find concepts in various stages of completion, from quick thoughts captured during my readings to full-blown theories about the different fields of work I’m engaged in.

You should know that this is, first and foremost, a private space for my own thinking, which I’m building in public in the hope that:

- it might be helpful to other people, and
- it might force me to be more disciplined with its pruning.

Because of this, you may very well find notes that are incomplete, nonsensical, or contradictory—when you do, know that the messiness you’re seeing is a feature, not a bug, and a necessary step toward a more polished output.

## Why keep a digital garden?

While my professional background is primarily in [[Software engineering]], I’ve always been fascinated by a number of different fields, such as [[Writing]], [[Photography]], [[Management]], [[Leadership]], [[Marketing]], [[Commerce]], and of course, [[Knowledge]] itself. As I started dabbling in more and more disciplines, I quickly realized that:

- I need to [[Ideas need to be grappled with|grapple with]] ideas to crystallize them. Otherwise, they just flow in and out of my mind without encountering the slightest friction.^[We Italians say, _”ti entra da un orecchio e ti esce dall’altro,”_ which roughly translates to _”in through an ear, out through the other.”_]
- One of my lifelong passions, [[Writing]], is an excellent tool for [[Writing is thinking across time|grappling with ideas over a long period]], acting as an extension of my own mind.
- The real value in having a broad range of interests is not becoming a master in any given field but rather in connecting distant fields.

My first attempt at using writing as a learning tool was to publish my own blog which, after a number of iterations, eventually landed on [Medium](https://medium.com/@aldesantis).

Unfortunately, I quickly realized that [[Blogs are suboptimal for learning]]: they discourage non-linear thinking in favor of building a highly linear, highly polished body of work. I kept blogging with varying levels of commitment for several years while keeping my eyes peeled for a better alternative.

I don’t quite remember how I first stumbled upon the concept of a [[Digital gardens]], but it resonated with me immediately: it felt like I had finally found a way to build a home for the million thoughts, theories, and questions that floated in my mind, and work on them at my own pace without losing any context.

A few years after starting my own garden, I can confidently say it’s one of the most satisfying and impactful projects I’ve had the pleasure to work on throughout my life.

## How I tend to my garden

Over the years, a few people have asked me what tools and processes I follow to work on my garden. For a brief period, I even taught a [[Knowledge]] course for our team at [Nebulab](https://nebulab.com).

The fundamental process is fairly simple:

1. I consume a variety of content: newsletters and blogs (through [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read)), e-books (through my Kindle), and podcasts (through [Snipd](https://www.snipd.com/)).
2. All the highlights I take are synced with [Readwise](https://readwise.io)^[Readwise and Readwise Reader are two separate products from the same company. Confusing, I know. They’re boh awesome though, so make sure to check them out.] and my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault.
3. Every day, I go through my highlights and [[turn-transient-notes-into-evergreen-notes|turn them into evergreen notes]] in my digital garden, which also lives in Obsidian—the one you’re currently reading.
4. During the weekend (or whenever time allows), I spend some time reorganizing my digital garden. There’s no fixed process for this: sometimes, I’ll start from a note I’m thinking about; more often, I’ll just open a random note and start from there.

My goal was to create a process that was:

- **Minimalistic.** By this, I mean that I want to use as few tools as possible with as few complications as possible. I like Readwise and Obsidian because they’re simple, beautiful, and still extremely powerful.
- **Flexible.** I have changed this process several times over the years, and I’m sure I will keep changing it as my needs evolve and I find better ways to do things. The current structure provides [[Build experimentation guidelines|experimentation guidelines]] to play with different workflows and without uprooting my entire digital garden.
- **Forgiving.** I’d love to spend my life going down fascinating rabbit holes and taking notes, but I have commitments to honor and bills to pay. [[Life is seasonal]], and I need a process that can accommodate this. I can go a day or a year without working on my notes–when I return, I can just pick up where I left.

## How to navigate this space

You’ll find three types of notes in my digital garden:

- **Maps of Content (MOCs):** These are index notes meant to be a starting point for specific topics or groups of notes. For example, [[Marketing]] is a good starting point if you want to understand my ideas on marketing. [[Recently updated]] and [[Most backlinked]] should be pretty self-explanatory.
- **Evergreen notes:** An evergreen note explores a specific idea. They are usually formulated in a conversational tone (e.g., [[Structure sets you free]]) so that they can be strung together to create a unified theory. Evergreen notes will typically be densely linked together with notes from the same and other fields.
- **Literature notes:** These are created automatically by [Readwise’s Obsidian plugin](https://github.com/readwiseio/obsidian-readwise). They contain the highlights from all the books, articles, and podcasts I consume so that I can reference back to the original content when working on my evergreen notes.^[Because I have _thousands_ of them and because they’re useless in isolation, literature notes are hidden from the sidebar. You can only access them through a link in an evergreen note.]

You will also find some miscellaneous content:

- **Now:** The [[Now]] page is a diary of events I am going through, content I am consuming, and projects I am currently working on. This is a running experiment and I’m still not entirely sure I want to make time for keeping it updated.

There’s no right or wrong way to go through a digital garden, which is what makes the process so fun in the first place. You can start from a random evergreen note that captures your attention and follow the links^[Some of the links you stumble upon may be broken. This can be the case when I link to a private page or a page that doesn’t exist yet, but I plan to create at some point.], or open a MOC to get a bird’s-eye view and then drill down from there.
