# Knowledge

Knowledge can be either [[Explicit knowledge|explicit]] or [[Tacit knowledge|tacit]].

- While [[Explicit knowledge]] is important to offer an entry point into new fields of knowledge, it rarely leads to mastery.
- [[Explicit knowledge can be captured]]

While explicit knowledge is essential to offer an entry point into new fields of knowledge, it rarely leads to mastery. Thatâ€™s where you need [[Tacit knowledge]] (see [[Learning is a four-phase process]]).

[[Tacit knowledge cannot be captured]]
