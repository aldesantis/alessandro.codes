## Ingredients


#### For the salad

- 60 g mixed salad greens (baby lettuce, arugula, baby spinach)
- 2 ripe nectarines
- 100 g brie
- 30 g walnuts
- 2 tbsp brown sugar

#### For the dressing

- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp honey (1 for the dressing + 1 to finish)
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar or balsamic vinegar
- fine salt (as needed)

## Method


#### Step 1: Caramelize the peaches

1. Wash the peaches and cut them into slices that are not too thin, leaving the skin on.
2. Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat.
3. Add the peach slices and sprinkle them evenly with brown sugar.
4. Cook for 5–6 minutes, gently turning now and then, until the sugar becomes golden caramel and the peaches look glossy.
5. Remove from the heat and let cool slightly.

#### Step 2: Prep the brie

1. Cut the brie into medium slices or cubes.
2. In a clean pan, warm the brie for 1–2 minutes over low heat, just to soften it without fully melting.
3. Remove and set aside.

#### Step 3: Make the dressing

1. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, 1 tbsp honey, the vinegar, and a pinch of salt.
2. Whisk until emulsified.

#### Step 4: Assemble

1. Wash and dry the salad greens well.
2. Divide the greens between two bowls.
3. Lightly dress the greens.
4. Arrange the caramelized peaches and softened brie on top.
5. Roughly chop the walnuts and scatter over.
6. Finish with a drizzle of the remaining honey and, if you like, a pinch of flaky salt.

### Tips

- Choose ripe but still firm peaches so they don’t fall apart.
- Swap brie for camembert for a stronger flavor.
- Add a few basil or mint leaves for a fresher twist.
- Serve right away to keep the contrast between warm peaches and crisp greens.
