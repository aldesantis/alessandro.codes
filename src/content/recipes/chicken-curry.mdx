## Ingredients

- 1.2 kg chicken thighs (bone-in, to debone)
- 100 g Greek yogurt
- water (as needed)
- fresh cilantro (as needed)

#### Curry spice mix

- 2 tsp ground turmeric
- 2 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1 tsp ground coriander seeds
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp fine salt

#### Aromatics

- 1 white onion
- 2 garlic cloves
- 20 g fresh ginger
- 2 fresh chilies
- extra-virgin olive oil (as needed)

## Method

1. Debone the chicken thighs and cut into about 3 cm pieces.
2. Finely chop the onion. Peel the garlic and remove the inner germ.
3. Halve the chilies and remove most of the seeds. Peel the ginger and dice.
4. Add the aromatics to a pan with a generous drizzle of olive oil and sauté for 10 minutes, stirring often.
5. Make the spice mix: mix turmeric, cinnamon, smoked paprika, ground coriander, cayenne, black pepper, and salt.
6. Add the spices to the pan and toast for 2 minutes, stirring.
7. Add the chicken and brown on all sides, then cover with water.
8. Simmer over medium heat for 35 minutes. Meanwhile, drain the yogurt to remove excess whey.
9. Turn off the heat, add the yogurt, and mix well.
10. Finish with chopped cilantro.
11. Serve with basmati rice, and optionally garnish with more cilantro and fresh chili.
