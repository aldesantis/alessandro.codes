## Ingredients

- 1 sheet of puff pastry (round)
- 80 g pumpkin (net weight)
- 100 g speck (thinly sliced)
- 100 g sweet provola
- 1 egg yolk + a splash of milk (for brushing)
- seeds to taste (sesame, poppy)

## Method

1. Remove the peel and seeds from the pumpkin, then slice it as thinly as possible (1–2 mm).
2. Slice the provola thinly as well.
3. Unroll the puff pastry with its baking paper directly onto a baking tray.
4. Arrange the speck in a rectangle in the center, then add the pumpkin and the provola.
5. Using a pizza wheel (or knife), cut diagonal strips about 2 cm wide along both sides, leaving the pastry intact above and below the filling.
6. Fold over the top short end, then braid the side strips alternately down to the bottom short end. Seal well by pressing with your fingers.
7. Brush with the yolk mixed with a splash of milk, then sprinkle with seeds.
8. Bake in a preheated static oven at 175–180 °C for about 30 minutes.
9. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.
