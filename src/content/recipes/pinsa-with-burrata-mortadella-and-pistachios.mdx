## Ingredients

- 2 ready-made pinsa romana bases
- 1 burrata (200 g)
- 150 g good-quality mortadella, thinly sliced
- 40 g toasted chopped pistachios
- mild extra-virgin olive oil
- freshly ground black pepper

## Method

1. Bake the pinsa bases at 220 °C for 5–6 minutes, until crisp and golden.
2. Tear the burrata roughly with your hands or a spoon so it spreads unevenly over the pinsa.
3. While the pinsa is still warm, add the burrata, then top with mortadella slices (folded into “roses” if you want more volume).
4. Sprinkle with pistachios. Finish with a light drizzle of olive oil and black pepper.
