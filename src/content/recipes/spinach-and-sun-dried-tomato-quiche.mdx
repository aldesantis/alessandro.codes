### Ingredients (makes 12 mini quiches)

- pine nuts
- puff pastry (1 sheet/roll)
- spinach (250 g)
- sun-dried tomatoes
- vegan ricotta (200 g)

### Method

1. Cut the puff pastry into circles using a muffin tin as a size guide.
2. Lightly oil a muffin tin and place the pastry circles inside.
    1. Alternative: you can bake them on an oiled baking tray if you don’t have a muffin tin.
3. Make the filling:
    - mix the spinach with the ricotta
    - blend with an immersion blender
    - season with salt
4. Spoon the cream onto each pastry circle.
5. Add a few pieces of sun-dried tomato on top of each quiche.
6. Bake:
    - Temperature: 190 °C (static oven)
    - Time: 20 minutes
    - They are ready when golden and crisp
7. Optional: add pine nuts or other seeds.
    1. If you want them toasted, add them before baking.

### Notes

- You can make them the same morning or the day before.
- To serve: reheat for a few minutes in a hot oven.
