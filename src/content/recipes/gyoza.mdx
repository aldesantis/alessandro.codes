4. Mix the vegetables with the ground pork.
5. Season with soy sauce, sesame oil, salt, and pepper.
6. Mix well until evenly combined.

#### Shape the gyoza

2. Use potato starch for dusting.
3. Roll each ball into a disc.
4. Place filling in the center.
5. Fold into a half-moon and pinch pleats along the edge.

#### Cook

2. Arrange the gyoza snugly.
3. Cook over high heat for about 10 seconds.
4. Lower the heat.

### Notes

- You can freeze the dumplings before cooking if all ingredients are fresh.
- Don’t make them too thick.
- Keep the right meat-to-veg ratio: too much meat makes them less flavorful.
