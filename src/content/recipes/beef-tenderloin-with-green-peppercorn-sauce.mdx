### Ingredients (serves 2)

- 2 whole beef tenderloin steaks (250–300 g each)
- 20 g green peppercorns in brine
- 200 g fresh heavy cream
- 100 g Dijon mustard
- 240 g beef stock
- 30 g brandy
- 40 g clarified butter
- salt (as needed)
- 00 flour (as needed)

### Method

1. Make the beef stock and keep it warm. Make sure all ingredients are at room temperature.
2. Tie the steaks with kitchen twine to keep their shape while cooking.
3. Lightly flour the steaks on both sides.
4. In a large nonstick pan, melt the clarified butter over medium-high heat.
5. Cook the steaks for about 2 minutes per side, turning with tongs (don’t pierce the meat).
6. Deglaze with brandy and let the alcohol evaporate (or flambé).
7. Lower the heat, turn the steaks, and add salt and the green peppercorns (drained).
8. Add the mustard, 50 g cream, and 50 g stock.
9. Raise the heat and cook for 2 more minutes per side, basting occasionally with the sauce.
10. Move the steaks to a rack, remove the twine, and let rest.
11. In the same pan, add the remaining 50 g cream and 70 g stock. Reduce slightly.
12. Return the steaks to the pan and briefly coat them in the sauce on both sides.
13. Serve hot with the sauce.
