## Ingredients

- 8 calamari (about 720 g)
- 30 g white wine (for cooking)
- parsley (as needed)
- extra-virgin olive oil (as needed)
- fine salt (as needed)
- lemon zest (as needed)

#### For the filling

- 100 g bread crumb
- 30 g Parmigiano Reggiano
- 6 anchovy fillets in oil
- 1 egg
- 1 garlic clove
- 30 g white wine
- parsley (as needed)
- black pepper (as needed)

## Method

1. Clean the calamari: separate head and body, remove innards and the transparent quill, rinse well.
2. Remove the skin, remove eyes and beak, and chop the tentacles.
3. Cut the bread crumb into cubes. Melt the anchovies in a pan with oil and garlic, add the tentacles and sauté.
4. Add the bread crumb, stir, then deglaze with white wine.
5. Transfer to a bowl: add parsley, Parmigiano, egg, pepper, and mix.
6. Fill the calamari tubes, leaving 1 cm from the edge, and close with toothpicks.
7. Brown the calamari in a pan with oil, season with salt, and brown on both sides.
8. Deglaze with white wine, let it evaporate, then cover and cook for 5 minutes.
9. Finish with lemon zest and chopped parsley.

### Storage

- Eat within 1 day, refrigerated in an airtight container.
- The filling can be made ahead.
- Can be frozen after cooking.

### Tip

- You can replace the egg with 1–2 tbsp milk for a softer filling.
- Alternative cooking: bake at 190 °C for 20 minutes.
