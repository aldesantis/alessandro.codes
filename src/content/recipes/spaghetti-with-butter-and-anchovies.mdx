## Ingredients

- 320 g spaghetti
- 70 g butter
- 80 g anchovies in oil
- 30 g panko
- salt (as needed)
- parsley (as needed)

## Method

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and cook the pasta.
2. In a saucepan, melt 60 g butter over low heat with 60 g anchovies and a ladle of pasta water.
3. Once the anchovies have melted, drain the pasta (reserve some cooking water) and add it to the pan with the butter and anchovies.
4. Toss well to combine, then add the remaining butter and another ladle of pasta water.
5. Emulsify, then add chopped parsley and the remaining anchovy fillets.
6. In a small pan, toast the panko with a drizzle of oil or a small knob of butter until golden and crisp.
7. Plate the pasta, add a spoonful of sauce, and finish with toasted panko.

Optional: add a drizzle of anchovy oil for a stronger flavor, or lemon zest for freshness.
