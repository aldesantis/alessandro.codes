## Ingredients

- 320 g fusilli
- 2 zucchini
- ½ onion
- 200 g canned tuna, drained
- 100 ml white wine
- Extra-virgin olive oil, to taste
- Fine salt, to taste
- Chopped parsley, to taste

## Method

1. Cook the pasta in a pot of boiling salted water.
2. Meanwhile, heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan and sauté the chopped onion.
3. Slice the zucchini into thin rounds using a mandoline so they are all a similar thickness.
4. Add the zucchini to the pan, season with salt, and cook for about 15 minutes.
5. Deglaze with the white wine, then add the well-drained tuna, stir, and let the flavors combine.
6. Drain the pasta al dente and transfer it to the pan, tossing to evenly distribute the sauce.
7. Add chopped parsley to taste.
8. Serve hot on a serving platter.
