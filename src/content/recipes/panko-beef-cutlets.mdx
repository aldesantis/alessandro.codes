## Ingredients

- 600 g beef topside, 4 slices of 150 g each
- Flour, as needed
- Panko, as needed
- 2 eggs
- 250 g clarified butter
- Fine salt, as needed

## Method

1. If the beef slices are too thick, pound them gently to make them thinner.
2. Coat each slice first in the flour.
3. Dip the floured slices into the beaten eggs.
4. Finally, coat the slices evenly with panko, tapping them lightly between each step to remove any excess.
5. Repeat until all 4 slices are breaded, then place them on a plate.
6. Melt the clarified butter in a large pan over medium heat until hot.
7. Fry the first cutlet in the hot butter for 2–3 minutes until golden.
8. Turn it using tongs and cook for another 2–3 minutes on the other side.
9. Remove the cutlet and place it on a tray lined with absorbent paper to remove excess fat.
10. Season with salt and serve the breaded beef cutlets hot.
