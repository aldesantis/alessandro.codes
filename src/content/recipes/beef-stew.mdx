### Ingredients (serves 4)

- 1 kg beef chunks
- 2.5 L beef stock
- 1 onion
- 1 carrot
- 1 celery stalk
- 1 glass red wine
- 4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 30 g butter
- 30 g 00 flour
- 1 sprig rosemary
- 1 sprig thyme
- 3 sage leaves
- salt and pepper

### Method

1. Heat the beef stock and keep it warm (you’ll need about 2–2.5 L).
2. Clean the celery, carrot, and onion and dice into 5–6 mm cubes.
3. Tie thyme, sage, and rosemary together with kitchen twine.
4. Cut the meat into 4–5 cm cubes.
5. In a casserole, heat butter and olive oil.
6. Add the diced celery, carrot, and onion and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes. If needed, add a little hot stock.
7. Add the beef, raise the heat, and brown well for about 10 minutes.
8. Season with salt and pepper.
9. Sprinkle with flour and toast for a couple of minutes, stirring often so it doesn’t burn.
10. Deglaze with red wine and let it evaporate completely.
11. Add the herb bundle and cover with hot beef stock.
12. Cover with a lid and simmer over medium heat for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally and adding more stock if it dries out too much.
13. At the end, remove the herb bundle and adjust salt if needed.
