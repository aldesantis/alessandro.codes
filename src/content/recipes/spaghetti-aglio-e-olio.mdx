## Ingredients

- 320 g spaghetti
- 3 garlic cloves
- 3 fresh chili peppers
- 70 g extra-virgin olive oil (high quality)
- Fine salt, to taste

## Method

1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil, salt it to taste, and cook the spaghetti until al dente.
2. Meanwhile, peel the garlic cloves, cut them in half, and remove the green inner core.
3. Slice the garlic into fairly thin slices.
4. Wash the fresh chili peppers, remove the stems, and slice them into rounds. For less heat, cut them lengthwise and remove the seeds before slicing.
5. Pour the olive oil into a large pan and heat it gently over low heat.
6. Add the garlic and chili pepper to the oil and let them gently sauté over very low heat for a couple of minutes, without letting them burn.
7. To ensure even browning without burning, slightly tilt the pan so the oil, garlic, and chili collect in one area.
8. When the spaghetti are al dente, transfer them directly to the pan with the sauce.
9. Add a ladle of the pasta cooking water.
10. Toss and sauté briefly to emulsify the sauce and coat the pasta evenly.
11. Serve immediately while hot.
