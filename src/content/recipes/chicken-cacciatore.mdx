### Ingredients (serves 4)

- 1 chicken (about 1.2–1.5 kg), cut into pieces
- 2 garlic cloves
- 1 small onion
- 1 carrot
- 1 celery stalk
- 400 g canned peeled tomatoes (or rustic passata)
- 1 glass red wine (Chianti or similar)
- 1 sprig rosemary
- 2 bay leaves
- extra-virgin olive oil
- salt and pepper

### Method

1. In a wide pan, heat a layer of olive oil and brown the chicken pieces until evenly golden. Remove and set aside.
2. In the same pan, add the finely chopped onion, carrot, and celery with the crushed garlic. Cook gently until softened.
3. Return the chicken, raise the heat, and deglaze with the red wine. Let it reduce almost completely.
4. Add the tomatoes (crushed), rosemary, and bay leaves. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat for about 45 minutes, turning occasionally. If needed, loosen with a little stock or hot water.
6. At the end the sauce should be thick, and the chicken tender but not falling apart.
