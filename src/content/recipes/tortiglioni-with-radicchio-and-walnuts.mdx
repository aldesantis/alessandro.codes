## Ingredients

- 400 g pasta (type of your choice)
- 1 red onion
- 1 head radicchio
- 70 g walnuts
- 2 tbsp grated vegan cheese
- 1 garlic clove
- a couple sage leaves
- a few rosemary sprigs
- extra-virgin olive oil (as needed)
- salt (as needed)
- chopped walnuts (to finish)

## Method

1. Slice the red onion thinly.
2. Slice the radicchio into rounds, then make 2–3 lengthwise cuts to avoid long strands.
3. In a pan, sauté the onion with a drizzle of oil for a few minutes.
4. Add the radicchio, season with salt, and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Bring a pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta.
6. Make the walnut pesto: blend walnuts, vegan cheese, garlic (optional), sage, rosemary, a pinch of salt, a drizzle of oil, and a small cup of water until smooth.
7. Drain the pasta al dente, reserving some cooking water.
8. Toss the pasta with the walnut pesto and the cooked radicchio.
9. Add a little pasta water and mix to make it creamy.
10. Serve with a sprinkle of chopped walnuts.
