### Ingredients (for 2 pinse)

- 2 ready-made pinsa romana bases
- 150 g smoked salmon
- 1 burrata (200 g)
- 50 g lamb's lettuce
- extra-virgin olive oil
- juice and zest of 1/2 unwaxed lemon
- balsamic glaze (as needed)
- salt and freshly ground black pepper

### Method

1. Heat the pinsa bases in a preheated oven at 220 °C for 5–6 minutes, until crisp outside and soft inside.
2. Meanwhile, drain the burrata and tear it into irregular pieces. Wash and dry the lamb's lettuce. Make a quick emulsion with 2 tbsp olive oil, a few drops of lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and pepper.
3. Once the pinsa is out of the oven, let it cool for a couple of minutes (so it doesn’t ruin the burrata).

    Spread the burrata pieces, add the smoked salmon slices and the lamb's lettuce. Dress with the lemon-and-oil emulsion.

4. Grate a little lemon zest over the top for freshness. Finish with thin drizzles of balsamic glaze.
