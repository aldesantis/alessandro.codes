### Ingredients (serves 2)

- 350 g cooked chickpeas
- 160 g pasta of your choice (better very small/short)
- 5–6 anchovy fillets (ONLY for omnivores)
- 2 garlic cloves
- a few rosemary sprigs
- extra-virgin olive oil (as needed)
- salt (as needed)
- pepper (as needed)

### Method

1. Rinse the chickpeas and (optionally) remove the skins.
2. Make a soffritto in a pan with oil, garlic, anchovy fillets, and rosemary. Cook until the anchovies melt.
3. Add the chickpeas and let them flavor for a few minutes.
4. Cover with about 500 ml water and simmer for a few minutes.
5. Meanwhile, make a raw anchovy-garlic paste by chopping garlic and anchovies into a paste.
6. Take about 3/4 of the chickpeas from the pan and blend until smooth.
7. Pour the blended chickpeas back into the pan with the remaining whole chickpeas.
8. Bring to a boil and cook the pasta directly in the chickpea sauce, adding more (ideally hot) water as needed.
9. At the end, stir in the anchovy paste.
10. Serve with finely chopped rosemary and black pepper to taste.

### Notes


If you are vegan, skip the anchovy paste.
