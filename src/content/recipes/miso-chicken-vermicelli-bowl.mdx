### Ingredients (serves 2)


#### Chicken and marinade

- 300–350 g chicken breast
- 2 tbsp red miso paste
- 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp garlic or ginger paste

#### Vermicelli

- 120–160 g dried rice vermicelli

#### Vegetables and toppings

- carrots
- cucumber
- red cabbage (or savoy cabbage)
- cashews

### Method

1. Cut the chicken breast into thin strips.
2. In a bowl, mix miso, oil, honey, and ginger. Add the chicken, cover, and marinate for at least 15 minutes.
3. Cut cucumber and carrots into julienne, and slice the cabbage thinly.
4. Soak/cook the vermicelli in hot water for 3–5 minutes (follow the package). Drain and toss with a little oil to prevent sticking.
5. Heat a nonstick pan and cook the marinated chicken until browned and cooked through.
6. When the chicken is almost done, add the vegetables and cashews and stir-fry briefly.
7. Add the vermicelli and toss to combine.
8. Serve. Great cold like a salad, or warm (reheat briefly if made ahead).
