### Ingredients

- 1 large cauliflower
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp smoked paprika (or curry, or both)
- coarse salt and pepper
- juice of 1/2 lemon
- chopped fresh parsley

### Method

1. Heat the oven to 200 °C (fan if possible).
2. Cut the cauliflower into steaks about 3 cm thick, trying to keep them intact. You can roast any outer pieces that crumble alongside.
3. Make a quick marinade: mix oil, paprika (or curry), salt, and pepper. Brush both sides of the steaks well.
4. Place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
5. Roast for 20–25 minutes, flipping halfway through. They should be golden and tender, with lightly caramelized edges.
6. Out of the oven, finish with a squeeze of lemon and fresh parsley.

With a sauce (yogurt and tahini, or curry mayo) this becomes a proper main dish.
