## Ingredients

- 215 g 00 flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- a pinch of salt
- 240 g mashed ripe banana (about 2 large bananas)
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 240 ml milk, room temperature
- 2 tbsp butter, melted and cooled
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 145 g fresh strawberries, chopped

## Method

1. In a large bowl, mix the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.
2. In another bowl, whisk the wet ingredients: mashed banana, eggs, milk, melted butter, and vanilla.
3. Gently combine the wet and dry ingredients until just mixed. Don’t overmix.
4. Fold in the chopped strawberries.
5. Let the batter rest for at least 5 minutes.
6. Heat a little butter or oil in a nonstick pan over medium heat.
7. Add about 2–3 tbsp batter per pancake. Cook for 3–4 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface and the edges look set.
8. Flip and cook for 1–2 minutes on the other side.
9. Wipe the pan between batches, especially if using butter.

### Tips

- For fluffier pancakes, keep eggs and milk at room temperature.
- Mash the bananas well (small lumps are fine).
- Don’t overmix the batter.
- Strawberries can be replaced with slightly thawed frozen strawberries.
- Store in the fridge for 3–4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
