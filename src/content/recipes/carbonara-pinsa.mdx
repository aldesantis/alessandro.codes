### Ingredients (serves 3)


#### Topping

- 3 medium whole eggs
- 6 egg yolks
- 60 g grated Parmigiano Reggiano
- 30 g grated pecorino romano
- black pepper (as needed)
- 150 g sliced guanciale
- 45 g pecorino romano, shaved

### Method

1. Use a vegetable peeler to shave the pecorino.
2. Cook the guanciale over low heat until crispy. Reserve the rendered fat.
3. Whisk together the eggs, yolks, Parmigiano, pecorino, and the guanciale fat.
4. Cook the mixture over a bain-marie, stirring constantly, until it reaches 60 °C and is smooth and velvety.
5. Brush the pinsa with oil and bake in a preheated static oven at 250 °C for 10 minutes, on an inverted baking tray or a very hot pizza stone.
6. Spread the egg cream on the hot pinsa, add the crispy guanciale, black pepper, and the pecorino shavings.
7. Serve immediately.
