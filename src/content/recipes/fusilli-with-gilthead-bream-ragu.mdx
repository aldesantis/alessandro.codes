## Ingredients

- 160 g pasta (mezze maniche, paccheri, or tagliolini)
- 400 g gilthead bream fillets
- 15 Pachino cherry tomatoes

#### Option 1: classic soffritto

- 1 celery stalk
- 1 shallot

#### Option 2: pre-made soffritto

- 2–3 tbsp frozen soffritto mix
- 100 ml white wine
- 2 tbsp tomato passata
- chopped pistachios (as needed)
- 2 basil leaves
- extra-virgin olive oil
- salt and pepper (as needed)

## Method

1. Bring a pot of salted water to a boil for the pasta.
2. Prep the fish:
    - rinse the bream fillets
    - remove the skin
    - pick out any bones
    - cut into 1 cm cubes
3. Make the soffritto (choose one):
    - Option 1: slice shallot thinly, dice celery, then sauté with oil in a nonstick pan.
    - Option 2: sauté the frozen soffritto mix with a drizzle of oil for 2–3 minutes.
4. Finish the sauce:
    - add the bream and chopped tomatoes
    - deglaze with white wine and let evaporate
    - add tomato passata
    - season with salt and pepper
    - cook for 3–4 minutes
5. Finish the dish:
    - drain the pasta and add directly to the pan
    - add a drizzle of oil
    - toss well
    - serve with chopped pistachios and finely sliced basil

### Notes

- You can use frozen bream fillets.
- You can swap bream for sea bass, cod, or grouper.
- Can be made the day before.
- Great for special occasions (Christmas Eve, New Year’s, Easter).
- If using a frozen soffritto mix, avoid carrots (their sweetness can throw off the flavor).
