## Ingredients

- 320 g Carnaroli rice
- 600 g delica pumpkin, cleaned
- 170 g gorgonzola (cold from the fridge)
- 100 g golden onion
- 30 g cold butter
- 50 g white wine
- 20 g extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 sprig rosemary
- fine salt (as needed)
- black pepper (as needed)
- 2.5 liters vegetable stock

## Method

1. Clean the pumpkin, removing the peel, seeds, and stringy parts. Slice thinly, then dice.
2. Steam the pumpkin for 15–20 minutes, until you can easily pierce it with a wooden skewer or fork.
3. Finely chop the onion and gently sauté it in extra-virgin olive oil over low heat for about 10 minutes, until translucent.
4. In the same pot, toast the rice dry for a few minutes over high heat, stirring often.
5. Deglaze with the white wine and stir until it evaporates.
6. Add the pumpkin to the rice and mash it into a purée.
7. Add stock one ladle at a time, stirring often and adding more only when the previous ladle has been absorbed.
8. Adjust salt and pepper toward the end of cooking, then turn off the heat.
9. Stir in the cold butter and the gorgonzola cut into pieces, mixing until creamy.
10. Serve immediately, finishing with small rosemary sprigs.
