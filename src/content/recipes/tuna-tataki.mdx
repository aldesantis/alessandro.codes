## Ingredients

- 300 g fresh tuna steak (sushi-grade, previously frozen if necessary)
- 35 ml soy sauce
- 10 g spring onion (green onion), sliced
- 5 g fresh ginger, sliced
- 5 ml rice vinegar
- 1 garlic clove
- Mustard, to taste
- Sesame seeds, to taste

For the ponzu sauce:

- 100 ml soy sauce
- 20 ml lime juice
- 20 ml lemon juice
- 15 ml orange juice
- 20 ml mirin
- 5 ml rice vinegar
- 7 g corn starch
- Water, as needed

## Method

1. Prepare the marinade by combining the soy sauce, sliced spring onion, garlic clove, sliced fresh ginger, and rice vinegar in a bowl.
2. Transfer the marinade to a food-safe bag, add the tuna steak, seal, and let it rest in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
3. Prepare the ponzu sauce: pour the soy sauce and lime juice into a small heavy-bottomed saucepan.
4. Add the lemon juice and orange juice.
5. Finish with the rice vinegar and mirin, place over the heat, and bring to a boil.
6. Stir in the corn starch dissolved in a little water, remove from the heat, and let the sauce cool until thick, glossy, and smooth.
7. Lightly toast the sesame seeds in a small non-stick pan for a few moments, stirring often and taking care not to burn them.
8. Remove the tuna from the marinade, drain well, and pat dry with kitchen paper.
9. Brush the tuna steak lightly with mustard.
10. Coat the tuna evenly with the toasted sesame seeds.
11. Heat a non-stick pan over high heat, add the tuna, and sear briefly for about 1 minute per side.
12. Once golden and crisp on the outside but raw in the center, remove the tuna from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board.
13. Slice the tuna into even slices about 1 cm thick.
14. Plate the tuna tataki, drizzle with a few spoonfuls of ponzu sauce, and serve immediately.
