#### Ingredients

- 300 g fresh tuna steak (sushi-grade, previously frozen if necessary)
- 35 ml soy sauce
- 10 g spring onion (green onion), sliced
- 5 g fresh ginger, sliced
- 5 ml rice vinegar
- 1 garlic clove
- Mustard, to taste
- Sesame seeds, to taste

#### Method

1. Prepare the marinade by combining the soy sauce, sliced spring onion, garlic clove, sliced fresh ginger, and rice vinegar in a bowl.
2. Transfer the marinade to a food-safe bag, add the tuna steak, seal, and let it rest in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.
3. Lightly toast the sesame seeds in a small non-stick pan for a few moments, stirring often and taking care not to burn them.
4. Remove the tuna from the marinade, drain well, and pat dry with kitchen paper.
5. Brush the tuna steak lightly with mustard.
6. Coat the tuna evenly with the toasted sesame seeds.
7. Heat a non-stick pan over high heat, add the tuna, and sear briefly for about 1 minute per side.
8. Once golden and crisp on the outside but raw in the center, remove the tuna from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board.
9. Slice the tuna into even slices about 1 cm thick.
10. Plate the tuna tataki, drizzle with a few spoonfuls of [[4527a38ff3cd481bbb60b97987705c9b|Ponzu sauce]], and serve immediately.
