## Ingredients

- 250 g fresh salmon fillet (previously frozen / sushi-grade)
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Lemon juice
- Chopped pistachios
- Salt
- Black pepper

## Method

1. Make sure the salmon fillet has been properly frozen for safety. If using fresh salmon, freeze it at −20°C (−4°F) for at least 24 hours, then thaw it in the refrigerator.
2. Remove the skin from the salmon with a sharp knife.
3. Slice the salmon into thin slices, then cut the slices into small cubes, carefully removing any bones.
4. Transfer the diced salmon to a bowl.
5. Season with a pinch of salt, black pepper, lemon juice, chopped pistachios, and extra virgin olive oil.
6. Place a ring mold in the center of a serving plate.
7. Fill the mold with the salmon and pistachio mixture, pressing gently with a spoon to compact it.
8. Carefully remove the ring mold.
9. Serve immediately.
