### Ingredients

- 300 g fresh tuna fillet
- Extra virgin olive oil, to taste
- Black pepper, to taste
- Fine salt, to taste
- 1 unwaxed lemon (zest only)

### Method

1. Take the tuna fillet (previously frozen for safety). Using a sharp knife, slice it first into thin slices and then into small, even dice. The more carefully and finely the tuna is worked with the knife, the better the tartare will be.
2. Transfer the chopped tuna to a bowl. Season with extra virgin olive oil, black pepper, and fine salt.
3. Grate the zest of an unwaxed lemon into the bowl and gently mix to combine.
4. Use a ring mold to shape the tuna tartare on the plate.
