## Ingredients

- 1 large savoy cabbage
- 460 g cooked chickpeas (drained weight)
- 2 carrots
- 1 red onion
- 80 g Taggiasca olives
- 3 tbsp tahini
- 1 garlic clove
- extra-virgin olive oil (as needed)
- fine salt (as needed)
- black pepper (as needed)

## Method

1. Remove 8 large, intact cabbage leaves.
2. Boil the leaves in plenty of salted water for 3 minutes, drain, and let cool draped over an upside-down bowl.
3. Finely chop the onion. Peel and cut the carrots into julienne.
4. In a pan, heat a drizzle of oil with the garlic. Add onion, carrots, salt, and a splash of water. Cook for 8 minutes.
5. Meanwhile, blend half the chickpeas with tahini, a glass of water, salt, and pepper until smooth.
6. Remove the garlic from the vegetables and add both the blended chickpeas and the whole chickpeas.
7. Add the olives and cook until the mixture dries out a bit. It should be soft but compact.
8. Fill the cabbage leaves with the chickpea mixture.
9. Fold in the sides and roll up.
10. Oil a baking dish large enough to fit the rolls.
11. Season with salt, pepper, and oil.
12. Bake in a preheated fan oven at 180 °C for 20 minutes.
13. Serve hot with a drizzle of olive oil.
