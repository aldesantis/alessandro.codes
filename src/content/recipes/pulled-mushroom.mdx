## Ingredients

- 500 g oyster mushrooms (pleurotus)
- 1 small espresso cup soy sauce
- 2 tbsp BBQ sauce
- 1 tbsp rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp vegetarian oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 garlic clove
- salt
- extra-virgin olive oil

## Method

1. Remove any dirt and tough stem parts. Rinse quickly under cold water (don’t soak).
2. Pull the mushrooms into small strips by hand or cut with a knife.
3. Put the mushrooms in a baking dish, drizzle with olive oil, and toss to coat.
4. Bake at 200 °C for 20–25 minutes, until dry and crisp.
5. Mix soy sauce, vegetarian oyster sauce, BBQ sauce, rice vinegar, sugar, and sesame oil.
6. In a pan, warm a little oil with the smashed garlic clove. Let it infuse over low heat, then add the mushrooms and briefly sauté.
7. Pour in the sauce, toss, and let it thicken slightly. Add about 1/2 glass of water to deglaze, then cook off until it clings to the mushrooms.
8. Use the pulled mushrooms to fill buns, wraps, tortillas, or steamed bao. Great hot or at room temperature.
