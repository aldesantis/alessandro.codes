## Ingredients

- 4 egg yolks
- 2 whole eggs
- 180 g Parmigiano Reggiano, 36 months
- 120 g pecorino romano
- guanciale or pancetta (as much as you like)
- spaghetti
- salt (as needed)
- black pepper (Tellicherry / Lungo del Bengala / your choice)

**Final ratio per serving:**


2 tbsp savory zabaglione + 1 tbsp crispy guanciale per plate.


## Method


#### Make the zabaglione

1. In a heatproof bowl, add 2 whole eggs + 4 yolks.
2. Whisk vigorously to partially denature the proteins.
3. Add, per person, 20 g pecorino + 30 g Parmigiano (50 g total per person) and keep whisking.
4. Set the bowl over a bain-marie at about 90 °C (water simmering, not boiling hard).
5. Keep whisking while:
    - the egg white proteins start to coagulate,
    - the cheese fats melt, making the cream fluid again.
6. Warm the zabaglione up to **62.5 °C**, without going over 63 °C.
7. Once it goes above 62 °C, remove from the heat and bring it back under 60 °C while whisking.
8. Repeat this hot/cool cycle **5 times**.
9. Cool it quickly by placing the bowl in ice water to stop coagulation.

#### Cook the guanciale

1. Cut the guanciale (or pancetta) and cook it in a pan until crispy.

#### Cook the pasta

1. Cook the spaghetti in salted water.
2. Meanwhile, heat a pan (not warm: it should be properly hot).
3. Drain the spaghetti directly into the pan, add 2 tbsp pasta water, and **toss vigorously** to release starch and create a creamy base.
4. Turn off the heat.
5. Add 2 tbsp savory zabaglione + 1 tbsp guanciale per serving.
6. Mix until you get the texture you want.

#### Plate

1. Twist the spaghetti onto plates.
2. Add extra crispy guanciale.
3. Finish with the pepper you chose (Tellicherry, Lungo del Bengala, etc.).
