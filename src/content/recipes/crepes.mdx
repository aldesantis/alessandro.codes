## Ingredients

- 3 medium eggs
- 250 g 00 flour
- 500 g whole milk
- 40 g butter

## Method

1. Melt the butter in a small saucepan and let it cool slightly.
2. In a tall bowl:
    - crack the eggs and whisk
    - add the milk and whisk until smooth
    - mix in the lukewarm melted butter
3. Sift the flour into the bowl through a sieve and whisk vigorously until the batter is smooth and lump-free.
4. Cover with plastic wrap and rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
5. Cook:
    - heat an 18 cm crêpe pan (or nonstick pan)
    - grease with a small knob of butter
    - pour in a ladle of batter and spread evenly
    - cook for about 1 minute over medium-low heat
    - flip when the edges lift
    - cook the other side for about 1 minute
    - repeat until the batter is used up

### Storage

- Batter: up to 12 hours in the fridge, covered.
- Cooked crêpes: 2 days in the fridge, covered.
- You can freeze crêpes separated by parchment paper.

### Notes

- The batter is neutral (no salt or sugar), so it works for both sweet and savory fillings.
- Butter in the batter is optional.
- Resting is essential to eliminate any lumps.
- You can use plant milk (rice, soy, oat) with the same ratios.
