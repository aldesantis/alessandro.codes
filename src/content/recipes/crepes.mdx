### Ingredients (makes about 14 crêpes)


**For the batter**

- 3 medium eggs
- 250 g 00 flour
- 500 g whole milk
- 40 g melted butter

**To grease the pan**

- butter (as needed)

### Method

1. Gently melt the butter in a small saucepan and let it cool slightly.
2. Crack the eggs into a tall bowl, whisk, then add the milk. Mix until smooth.
3. Add the lukewarm butter and mix again.
4. Sift the flour into the bowl (even in two batches) and whisk vigorously until smooth and lump-free.
5. Cover the bowl and rest the batter in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
6. Stir the batter, then heat an 18 cm crêpe pan or nonstick skillet and grease it with a little butter.
7. Pour in enough batter to coat the surface, spreading it quickly and evenly.
8. Cook for about 1 minute over medium-low heat until the edges start to lift. Flip and cook the other side for 1 more minute.
9. Stack the crêpes as you cook them to keep them soft. You should get about 14 crêpes.
