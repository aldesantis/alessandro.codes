Over the years, a few people have asked me what tools and processes I follow to work on my garden and this website, so here’s my best attempt at explaining the process.

## How I tend to my garden

The fundamental process is fairly simple:

1. I consume a variety of content: newsletters and blogs (through [Readwise Reader](https://readwise.io/read)), e-books (through my Kindle), and podcasts (through [Snipd](https://www.snipd.com/)).
2. All the highlights I take are synced with [Readwise](https://readwise.io) and, from there, with my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault through the official Readwise plugin for Obsidian.
3. Every day, I go through my highlights and [[turn-transient-notes-into-evergreen-notes|turn them into evergreen notes]] in my digital garden, which also lives in Obsidian—the one you’re currently reading.
4. During the weekend (or whenever time allows), I spend some time reorganizing my digital garden. There’s no fixed process for this: sometimes, I’ll start from a note I’m thinking about; more often, I’ll just open a random note and start from there.

My goal was to create a process that was:

- **Minimalistic.** By this, I mean that I want to use as few tools as possible with as few complications as possible. I like Readwise and Obsidian because they’re simple, beautiful, and still extremely powerful.
- **Flexible.** I have changed this process several times over the years, and I’m sure I will keep changing it as my needs evolve and I find better ways to do things. The current structure provides [[build-experimentation-guidelines|experimentation guidelines]] to play with different workflows and without uprooting my entire digital garden.
- **Forgiving.** I’d love to spend my life going down fascinating rabbit holes and taking notes, but I have commitments to honor and bills to pay. [[life-is-seasonal|Life is seasonal]], and I need a process that can accommodate this. I can go a day or a year without working on my notes–when I return, I can just pick up where I left.
