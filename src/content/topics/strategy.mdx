Strategy is the art of devising the most effective and efficient way of taking a system (an organization, one’s career, etc.) from point A to point B. As such, strategic thinking is a foundational skill for any entrepreneur—dare I say, for any human being.

My all-time favorite books about strategy are both by Richard Rumelt: [[good-strategy-bad-strategy|Good Strategy/Bad Strategy]] and [[the-crux|The Crux]]. [A Smart Bear](https://longform.asmartbear.com/jason-cohen/), a blog by Jason Cohen, the co-founder of WP Engine, is also incredibly interesting.

Both Cohen and Rumelt postulate that strategy [[good-strategy-is-simple|is simple]], [[strategy-deals-with-present-challenges|deals with present challenges]], and [[strategy-requires-original-insights|requires original insights]]. This is in stark contrast with most fill-in-the-blanks strategic thinking frameworks (e.g., SWOT analysis): most of these frameworks lead to a lot of hand-waving and the appearance of insight, whereas in reality they’re simply remixing shallow and hardly actionable observations about the state of a system.

Because it deals with systems, strategy is tightly coupled with [[systems-thinking|systems thinking]].
