Writing is the first thing I remember falling in love with: I started creating stories in kindergarten, and I’ve never stopped since—it’s just that the stories have, for the most part, become fictional and contain more numbers.

I love writing because I love thinking, and [[writing-is-thinking-across-time|writing is simply thinking across time]]. In fact, my writing practice is strongly tied to [[knowledge-management|knowledge management]].

If you want to write more but don’t know where to start, I strongly recommend [[the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online|The Ultimate Guide to Writing Online]].
