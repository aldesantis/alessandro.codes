While I started my career as a [[software-engineering|software engineer]], I quickly understood that I was much more interested in the real-world impact of my work than in the craft of software engineering _per se._ I also understood that, in most industries, the only way to increase your impact past a certain threshold is to build and lead organizations.

This led me to become a technology leader, holding CTO positions at different companies and learning more (primarily by screwing up) about [[systems-thinking|systems thinking]], organizational design, performance management, and change management.

To me, leadership is the art of [[the-organization-is-the-work|working on the organization]] by:

- [[an-operating-cadence-needs-shared-vision|Building shared vision]]
- [[org-design-is-about-structure-incentives-and-culture|Setting structure, incentives, and culture]]
- [[design-an-operating-cadence|Designing an operating cadence]]
- [[good-management-requires-consistency|Staying consistent over time]], but also
- [[change-requires-an-activation-energy|Initiating change when needed]]
