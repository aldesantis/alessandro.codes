While “customer experience” (CX) is a vague term that takes on different meanings depending on what the vendor of the day is trying to sell you, I think it’s best defined as the sum of all the interactions a customer has with your brand over time.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Discovering and learning about your product
- Purchasing your product (online, in-store, etc.)
- Using and maintaining your product
- Dealing with product issues
- Engaging with your brand post-purchase (e.g., through loyalty programs, editorial experiences, etc.)

My interest in customer experience (CX) is closely related to my interest in [[commerce]] and [[marketing]], because a good CX allows you to maximize your marketing ROI or, to put it more harshly, squeeze more dollars out of your traffic.
