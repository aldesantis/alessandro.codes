I’ve been a consultant for most of my life, first as a solo consultant and then as part of larger organizations such as [Gigster](https://gigster.com) and [Nebulab](https://nebulab.com).

The problem with consulting is that it’s very hard to define—for me, consulting is primarily the art of [[consulting-involves-tension|navigating tension]] and [[consulting-is-the-gift-of-perspective|offering perspective]].

Furthermore, while most people think of consultants as outsourced workers, there are actually [[there-are-three-types-of-consulting|three types of consulting]]. Like many of those who over-intellectualize the subject, I’m most fascinated by researching and advancing the third type, collaborative consulting (which is also the most fun!).

These are some of my foundational reads about consulting over the years:

- [[managing-the-professional-service-firm|Managing the Professional Service Firm]]: the bible of consulting, covering everything from delivery to business development to people management.
- [[the-trusted-advisor|The Trusted Advisor]]: how to build, maintain, and leverage trust in a consulting engagement to get results, both for the clients and ourselves.
- [[flawless-consulting|Flawless Consulting]]: an overview of the different types of consulting relationships and how consultants move between them.

I would also strongly recommend [Tom Critchclow](https://tomcritchlow.com/)’s content, which is all excellent.
