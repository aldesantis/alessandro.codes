I come from a software engineering background, and I still consider myself a software engineer at heart. Despite my passion for the humanities, I have a very analytical mind, so I tend to think in terms of problems, frameworks, processes, and solutions, no matter what I’m doing.

Unfortunately, I started this digital garden long after I stopped writing code for a living, which means you won’t find many notes about the more technical aspects of software engineering. You may find more philosophical considerations about how software should be designed, built, and maintained, which I am backfilling over time (e.g., [[software-should-be-tested-in-production|Software should be tested in production]] and [[mvp-is-not-half-assed|MVP is not half-assed]]).

_Fun fact:_ The domain for this website, [alessandro.codes](https://alessandro.codes) (“Alessandro _codes!_”), comes from the surprise painted on people’s faces when they learn that I can still, in fact, understand and write software. It’s a tongue-in-cheek reference to the interesting arc of my professional career.
