I started becoming interested in commerce when I joined [Nebulab](https://nebulab.com), where we help mid-market and enterprise brands use technology to launch unique shopping experiences. That led me down a rabbit hole of branding, [[marketing]], [[customer-experience|customer experience]], and much more.

Over time, I fell in love with how brands are born, how they shape and are shaped by our culture, and how they become symbols for certain values, aesthetics, and lifestyles. In fact, I’ve come to think that [[commerce-is-the-most-democratic-form-of-art|commerce is the most democratic form of art]]. As a result, I’ve become passionate about helping brands connect with their consumers, initiate change, and make lives better.

Because commerce is a very broad topic, you’ll find very few notes explicitly tagged as such in this garden. Most of my commerce-adjacent content is tagged with [[marketing]], so I would encourage you to start your exploration there.
