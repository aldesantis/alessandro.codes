## Summary

Amazon is producing record profits while investing more than ever before. It reported $22.6 billion in capital expenditures in the third quarter â€” a new high. It also reported $15.3 billion in net income, a new high, too.

## Highlights
- This is the Amazon everyone should have feared because it has AWS in its back pocket and a retail business that is getting faster at delivering items while also improving margins.
