## Summary

Dôen is a successful fashion brand that grew to eight figures without relying on Meta ads, targeting fashion-savvy moms. The brand uses distinctive photography and a “drop” strategy to create demand while navigating trends and expanding its product offerings. Dôen’s approach shows that brands can balance performance marketing with unique branding and still achieve significant growth.

## Highlights

- All of the brand’s live ads feature a logo, and sometimes a tagline highlighting the collection or the product featured in the photo. This is relatively new; as recently as six months ago they didn’t put the logo on every single ad.
  ​
  I advise brands _not_ to do this when they’re first starting out on Meta unless the brand has massive IRL awareness. The reason? It’s another indicator that the viewer is watching an ad, which typically drives down CTR.
- Does Dôen’s website look cool? Yeah (as long as you’re not trying to find something specific). Does that mean you should throw usability out the window and do whatever your heart desires? No.
  ​
  Dôen created a strong pool of brand awareness outside of Meta and paired it with a “drop” strategy that stokes consumer demand. TL;DR they can make potential customers “work for it”. Can you _really_ say the same?
