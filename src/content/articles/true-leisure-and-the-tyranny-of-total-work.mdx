## Summary

Don’t define your life by a to-do list you can never finish

## Highlights

- Work is productive. Work puts food on the table. Work is _virtuous._ While societal narratives recognize that compulsive working is unhealthy—hence the term “workaholism”—your relationship to work has to deteriorate to quite an extent before such protective mechanisms kick in. The culture encourages and rewards unhealthy attitudes towards work.

- Total work is a state of being where work is the central and defining focus of life. Put another way, total work is what happens when leisure ceases to exist.

- According to Pieper, leisure is the capacity to “just be” without the need for distraction. Consider what happens when you have nothing in particular to occupy your attention. Often, it’s in these moments that you find challenging feelings becoming more salient in your awareness. This is the loop that keeps driving so many of us back to distraction.

- What Piepier is pointing to is the fact that leisure is not a break from work, because to decide to take time off _from work_ is to assert that life is defined by work. In the same way as a weekend is defined in relation to the week, vacations and similar things that may look like leisure are in fact defined in relation to work.
- In exchange for liberating ourselves from the shackles of social systems where humans and animals are the sole sources of labor, we get to navigate the new psychology of freedom, economies predicated on endless growth, and hence a seemingly inexhaustible to-do list.
