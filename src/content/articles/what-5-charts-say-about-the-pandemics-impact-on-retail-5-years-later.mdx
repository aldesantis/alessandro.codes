## Summary

The pandemic caused major disruptions in retail, leading to store closures and bankruptcies even years later. While e-commerce grew significantly, many physical retailers are now facing challenges due to inflation and changing consumer habits. Experts predict that store closures will be worse in 2025 than during the height of the pandemic, as the effects of stimulus spending fade.

## Highlights

- According to Gargan, U.S. retail e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales (excluding automotive) had reached roughly 22% as of Q4 last year. That’s compared to roughly 15% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Looking at the U.S. Commerce Department’s monthly numbers, e-commerce sales in December 2024 were more than $60 billion higher than they were five years previously, a 66% gain in that time period.
- The idea that stores will be replaced by e-commerce is still nowhere near the truth, but Mercer noted that there is more of an emphasis on where physical retail can prove its worth. The way Coresight Research views it, stores should provide convenience, collection services (as in the picking up of orders), discount offerings or be a destination for shoppers.
