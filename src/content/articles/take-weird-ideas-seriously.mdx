## Summary

Weird Ideas as Individual Alpha and Societal Necessity

## Highlights

- On the societal level, weird ideas are how we avoid getting trapped in locally stable but globally suboptimal equilibria.
- The Adjacent Possible says that you can only discover what’s adjacent to where you already are. Alchemy opened possibilities in physics that pure mechanics never would have. You need weird leaps to open up new adjacencies. The weird idea makes _other_ ideas thinkable. It expands the search space.
