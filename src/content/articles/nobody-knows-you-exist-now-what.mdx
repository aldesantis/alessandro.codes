## Summary

And if you feel shy about this, here’s the good news - promoting yourself doesn’t have to mean selling your product or service with big, flashing lights like a Las Vegas casino.

## Highlights

- Don’t just show the polished, final product. Share your messy sketches, discarded first drafts, and the late-night white-boarding or Notion sessions.
- Don’t be afraid to ruffle some feathers. If you’re always Mr. or Mrs. Safe Opinion, why should anyone pay attention to you? People are drawn to people with conviction.
