## Summary

Amjad Masad, the founder of AI-unicron Replit, believes that programming skills will become more important in an AI-driven world, since AI tools are inherently augmenting rather than automating. He thinks that these tools might change the required skills of programmers, who will act more as guides or managers in many cases, but they will still be needed to fill in gaps and control the models’ possible mistakes. However, Masad also argues that AI doom is caused by players’ incentives to oversell or overstate AI’s capabilities, creating a cycle of hype and fear. Masad also suggests that bundling and vertical integration could be a strategy for AI startups to win against incumbents.

## Highlights

- GPT-2 to GPT-3 was the birth of a new technology. But GPT-3 to GPT-4 is an incremental jump. GPT-4 has less hallucination, it’s more predictable, it has a bigger context window—but it’s just technical incremental improvement. We’re really hitting diminishing returns on the current architecture of these models.

- People were way undershooting on the potential of AI for a long time, and now they’re way overshooting.

- This type of bundling and vertical integration is something I’d recommend startups who want to build in AI think about as a strategy.
