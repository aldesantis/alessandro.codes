## Summary

Positionless Marketing helps marketers quickly create personalized campaigns using AI and real-time data. It lets them connect with customers at the right moment across many platforms without delays. This approach boosts engagement and makes marketing more agile and effective.

But in reality, first impressions are highly indicative of customer behavior.”
