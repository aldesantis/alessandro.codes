## Summary

We’d all like life to be simpler. But we also don’t want to sacrifice our options and capabilities. Tesler’s law of the conservation of complexity, a rule from design, explains why we can’t have both.

## Highlights

- Our perception of a product or service as simple or complex has its basis in the conceptual model we have of it.

- When we want something to be simpler, what we truly need is a better conceptual model of it.
- The total complexity of a system is a constant. If you make a user’s interaction with a system simpler, the complexity behind the scenes increases.
