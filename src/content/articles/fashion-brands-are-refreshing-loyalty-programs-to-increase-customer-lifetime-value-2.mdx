## Summary

As customer acquisition costs continue to rise, fashion brands are doing everything they can to make the most of their existing customers. Brands like Levi’s are increasingly relying on loyalty program refreshes and relaunches, providing new perks and pushing those programs in marketing to bring in more members.

## Highlights

- other brands are refreshing their loyalty programs to direct customers toward the areas of the business with the strongest conversion.
- Paid memberships, like Amazon Prime, also offer brands a reliable source of transactions from a recurring customer, but acquiring new members can be just as hard — if not harder — than acquiring single-transaction customers. Amazon, for example, spends around $160 to acquire a new Prime customer. Meanwhile, the average fashion or apparel brand spends around $66 to acquire a new customer.
