## Summary

LVMH has launched 22 Montaigne Entertainment in partnership with Superconnector Studios to develop film, TV, and audio productions for its 75+ luxury brands. This endeavor aims to bring the rich histories of brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Tiffany & Co. to life through premium entertainment experiences. By collaborating with experienced storytellers, LVMH seeks to create authentic and compelling content that aligns with the values and heritage of each Maison, allowing for the exploration of various entertainment formats while maintaining the brands’ autonomy and identity.

## Highlights

- “At LVMH, we view each Maison as a house of stories, a distinct creator of culture,” Melwani said. “We embrace the belief that these narratives are meant to be experienced rather than simply told, and our goal is to further leverage premium entertainment as a means to share the richness of these tales with our customers.”
