## Summary

Money can solve many business problems, but the most valuable things, like finding great team members and building authority, cannot be bought. It’s important to show investors how money can improve specific areas of your business while also demonstrating your ability to master skills that money can’t buy. Ultimately, combining money with knowledge and adaptability increases the chances of business success.

## Highlights

- Concepts, behaviors, knowledge, and process cannot be fabricated with money, and possibly cannot even be accelerated. Once you know what to do or, more likely, you know how to learn quickly, then money becomes an accelerant.
