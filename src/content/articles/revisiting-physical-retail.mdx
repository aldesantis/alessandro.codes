## Summary

The good, the bad and the ugly

## Highlights

- The opening of a new store leads to an average 37 percent increase in overall web traffic for brands, according to International Council of Shopping Centers. Biased or not, the study confirms what marketers know: the halo effect is real, and investing in physical retail is today cheaper than any of the performance media buys.

- Today, a product purchase is not a core user activity. Instead, what’s core to users may be participating in a community, having access to high-quality lifestyle content, benefiting from personalization, attending events, identifying with an aesthetic POV or a social message, enjoying VIP membership perks, or experiencing a superior delivery service or a celebrity connection. Most successful retailers today monetize their businesses around these activities. Their business models do not revolve around their products, and their physical stores reflect this shift.
- For a lot of consumers, shopping is losing its clout. In its place are exercise, travel, home decor, nutrition and identification with a social cause. This is the new ammunition for personal currency. Stores like Goop trade in this new currency by displaying a full-blown lifestyle, as well as the values, beliefs and motivations that underpin it. Together, they are tangible and shoppable demonstrations of a specific social point of view.
- Along with turning their stores into immersive and interactive theme park-like journeys, retailers like Winky Lux and Glossier invest in creating viral experiences with a high novelty factor. The central idea is not that visitors will go to the store to buy something; the idea is that they’ll heavily Instagram it so their friends will want to visit and buy something.
- This strategy expands retail from stores into hotels, Airbnb apartments, co-working spaces and standalone accommodations. A Ma Maniére is an Atlanta-based men’s streetwear retailer that, in addition to its three-floor store, offers a “living concept” next door. Customers can rent an apartment fully equipped with A Ma Maniére products, including clothes, furniture, kitchen appliances, decorative objects and tech.
