## Summary

The document discusses the importance of forming deep connections with others and the fear and beliefs that can hold us back from doing so. It suggests that instead of waiting for others to find us, we should be vulnerable and take the first step in forming connections. By embracing our individuality and being open to rejection, we can create meaningful relationships and experience the small moments that make life worth living. The document encourages readers to let the others find them by being open and authentic.

- The depth of connections we form with each other defines the quality of our lives. Creating and exploring that depth is the process of creating closeness as we move from stranger to friend.
- If weâ€™re not careful we can find ourselves in a vicious circle of alienation, craving connection but not knowing how to find it. Instead of seeing future friends around us, we see strangers to avoid. The more we see others as causes of pain or as unworthy of our attention, the less we reach out.
