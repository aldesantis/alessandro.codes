## Summary

Resilience isn’t about pretending you’re fine or never feeling pain—it’s about learning how to act in your best interest despite the pain.

## Highlights

- You don’t build resilience by feeling good all the time.
  You build resilience by getting better at feeling bad.
- To deny pain is to deny our own potential growth.
