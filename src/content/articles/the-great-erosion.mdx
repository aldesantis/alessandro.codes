## Summary

On the fine line between AI augmentation and cognitive atrophy

## Highlights

- By the time organisations notice that all their creative work feels samey, that it lacks the spark of genuine originality, that it’s all starting to blur together into a kind of competent blandness, they’ve potentially lost years of skill development across entire cohorts. And you can’t get that back. You can’t restore experience from backup.
- Fine is the sound of a creative industry eating itself from the inside out while congratulating itself on its efficiency gains.
