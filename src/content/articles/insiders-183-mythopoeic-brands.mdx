## Summary

Brands can be seen as myths that explain and shape our understanding of products and services. Myth-making involves observing forms and transformations, allowing people to create their own stories and perspectives. By resurfacing existing myths and facilitating new interactions, brands can help customers connect with these narratives in meaningful ways.

## Highlights

- The observation of the form is the critical moment: perhaps something that is missing from the equation is _focus._ If observation is participation (and it is) a moment of definition—the focus of the observation is context-dependent.
- Perspective transmitted from person to person is not in fact observation but reinforcement of judgment of form—a single collapsing of form.
- Mythology is alive; content is dead on arrival.
