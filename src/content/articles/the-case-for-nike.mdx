## Summary

Nike is facing challenges as it relies on older sneaker designs while youth culture shifts. The brand must reconnect with consumers by embracing innovation and social responsibility. There are opportunities for Nike to diversify beyond fashion and restore its reputation as a cultural leader.

## Highlights

- Maybe it’s not that we have less monoculture today; it’s that we’re more aware of everything else in the other quadrants of the chart.
- But today, American shoppers hold a strained relationship with big business, influenced by sentiments around wealth disparity and corporate abuse (From Occupy to Big Tech and Big Pharma). In the presidential race, both candidates use small business as a talking point to win the sympathy of voters.
- As trust in institutions (church, banks, colleges) sinks to [all-time-lows](https://news.gallup.com/poll/508169/historically-low-faith-institutions-continues.aspx), faith in small business is up, transcending [political lines](https://www.greenamerica.org/blog/americans-trust-small-businesses), with “nearly all adults ([97%](https://bobbyhundreds.substack.com/news.gallup.com/poll/270296/americans-dislike-big-business.aspx)) [having] a positive view of “small business.”
- Knight stated, “If we’re gonna be successful again, we don’t try to be cool. You can’t manage Cool.” However, “We try to be innovative maker of shoes and clothes and great product and advertising that go with it.”
- For every Nike misstep over the generations, Phil Knight’s atoned by infusing the product with value – namely, ramping up quality and innovation. But what happens when consumer psychology shifts? What does Nike do if the shopper perceives value as prestige or profitability instead of performance? The game becomes less about technical design and superior construction and more about scarcity and clout.
- Good stories tell you something about the hero. Great stories tell you something about yourself.
