## Summary

Playing "Civilization 7" is similar to management consulting, as both involve strategic resource allocation and can require tough sacrifices for success. The game allows players to lead any civilization with any historical figure, reflecting a flexible but potentially dehumanizing approach to leadership. While video games can teach valuable skills, there's a concern that they may lead tech leaders to view others as mere tools in their pursuit of victory, rather than as real people.

## Highlights
- You can probably guess why it reminds me of consulting—the game of *Civilization* and the one that firms like McKinsey play in real life aren’t all that different. They, too, are tasked with efficient resource allocation. They, too, will sometimes have to sacrifice many people to achieve victory. The gaming software of choice was Excel, but there isn’t all that much difference between optimizing financial models and optimizing a civilization.
- I worry that big tech CEOs view everyone other than themselves as NPCs (non-playable characters).
