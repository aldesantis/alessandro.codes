## Summary

The author reflects on choosing to be open or closed to life's experiences and the power of saying "welcome" and "thank you" with a smile. By embracing all of life, including pain and challenges, she aims to live fully and authentically. The message is about finding joy and connection by opening up to the world, even in the face of difficulties.

## Highlights
- The trouble is, as soon as you close your heart to one thing — to anything — you close your heart. It doesn’t work in increments. As soon as I begin to say no and pull away, there is a contraction, and that contraction closes me off. So I have to ask the question: do I want be open, or closed? Then I have to follow through. I have to acknowledge that to say ‘no’ to the cloud means also saying no to the tight fists of the peonies next to me too.
