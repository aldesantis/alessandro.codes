## Summary

Gymshark will open its first two permanent U.S. stores in New York this fall and calls them “only the beginning.” The brand is expanding physical retail slowly and intentionally to grow in the U.S., which makes up about half its sales. Gymshark hopes stores will boost both in-store and online sales while keeping the brand curated and locally relevant.

## Highlights

- per data from the ICSC, opening a new store leads to a 6.9% increase in a brand’s online sales in that trade area. For direct-to-consumer brands, that doubles to 13.9% after a store opening.
