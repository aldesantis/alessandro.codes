## Summary

There’s a better way to spread the fruits of innovation.

## Highlights

- Following the Dutch experience, economists use the term “Dutch Disease” to describe situations in which massive success in one sector undermines the economy’s long-term prospects as a whole.

- This dynamic — wage growth in industries with low or limited productivity growth — is now [called](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baumol%27s_cost_disease) Baumol’s Cost Disease. It has been used to explain the increase in the cost of a variety of in-person services and as an argument for why some services — particularly healthcare, education, and the arts — should be funded by the state and not by for-profit entities.

- “The **tragedy of the commons** refers to a situation in which individuals with access to a public resource (also called a common) act in their own interest and, in doing so, ultimately deplete the resource.”

- Kwon and Sorensen called this phenomenon The Silicone Valley Syndrome: An expansion in the number of highest _and_ lowest-paying jobs. Resulting in a hollowing out of the middle and an overall increase in inequality. The middle class disappears while “the poor do no better” and “the rich get richer.”

- The critical thing to note is that the success of _some_ makes basic services more expensive for _all_. The counter-argument is that healthcare and education _should_ embrace innovation and become more productive to keep costs down. I agree. But for now, they haven’t done so at a comparable rate to other sectors. And in any case, productivity gains in some industries will always lag behind others.
- Baumol’s Cost Disease contributes to inequality by making essential services less affordable for most people. The growing cost (or deteriorating quality) of healthcare and education also undermines overall prosperity.

- More broadly, tech-powered success can increase inequality, undermine the quality of life for the majority of the population, and diminish the odds of future success.
  This happens through three (or more) mechanisms:
  1. The Dutch Disease: When one industry is booming, it reshapes the economy and makes it harder for other industries to remain competitive. This is true for tech as it is true for gas.
  2. Baumol’s Cost Disease: When some people start to earn much more, everyone else needs to spend more in order to maintain their current lifestyle. And the biggest impact is on crucial things like education, healthcare, and essential services.
  3. The Tragedy of the Commons: We are “harvesting” brilliant innovations made by wonderful people in a way that diminishes the production of healthy educated people who are willing to take risks.
- It’s easy to conclude that we no longer need to educate _so_ many people and spend so much on their health and well-being. Implicitly, this seems to be America’s operating assumption: Let the winners win, and let everyone else struggle to access basic services.
