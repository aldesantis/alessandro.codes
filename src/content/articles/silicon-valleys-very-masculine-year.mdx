## Summary

Silicon Valley has seen a shift towards a more masculine culture in recent years. The leaders of the tech industry are embracing a more muscular and aggressive image, with a focus on physical strength and combat. This shift has led to a decrease in diversity and representation of women in tech leadership roles. The change in culture can be attributed to factors such as the desire for financial success and the influence of influential figures like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Additionally, the competitive nature of the industry has contributed to a more ruthless and cutthroat environment.

## Highlights

- Gone is the delicate, ascetic presence of [Jack Dorsey](https://www.vox.com/jack-dorsey) and the laissez-faire leadership of Sheryl Sandberg. Gone are [the girl bosses](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2023/09/where-have-all-the-girlbosses-gone). In their absence, the richest, most powerful men in tech are leading Silicon Valley toward a more macho future, one in which strength can be measured in muscles, women are absent from the boardroom, and ruthlessness is a virtue.

- When I started working in this space [a decade ago], it was very male dominated, but everyone pretended to include women,” said Joelle Emerson, CEO of Paradigm Strategy, a Silicon Valley consulting firm that specializes in diversity and inclusion. “Now, it’s still very male dominated, but nobody feels the need to pretend that it’s true. ”
- As we enter 2024, it’s clear that Silicon Valley’s masculinity phase is far from over. While the pendulum may eventually shift toward a climate that’s slightly more welcoming to women and minorities, it seems unlikely that social progress will become a priority anytime soon within the tightening tech economy.
