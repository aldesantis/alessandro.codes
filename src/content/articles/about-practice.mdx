## Summary

The author shares their experience of learning to play the viola, realizing that enjoying performance doesn't always mean enjoying practice. They emphasize the importance of distinguishing between what you like to perform and what you enjoy practicing. Ultimately, finding what you love to practice is key to long-term happiness and fulfillment.

## Highlights
- *just because you love performing something, doesn’t mean you love practicing it.* And if you don’t love practicing something, you shouldn’t dedicate your life to it. You won’t be truly happy, and you won’t get the long-term results you want either.
- *Practice is about the process. Performance is about the payoff.*
  *Practice is about progress. Performance is about praise.*
  *Practice is for yourself. Performance is for other people.*[2](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/about-practice/#footnote-2-148980716)
- *One problem with being ‘good enough’ at things is that it’s hard to quit them.*
- Ask yourself what you like to perform versus what you actually like to practice. The catch is that you can’t answer the question without *trying* things. You don’t find what you love in theory — you find it in practice (*pun very much intended*).
- What you like to practice is what’s worth pursuing. Getting to perform is just a bonus.
