## Summary

Skims is rapidly growing, with a valuation of $4 billion and $750 million in revenue for 2023, but needs to innovate its brand beyond just product offerings. To achieve long-term success, Skims should focus on creating an emotional connection with consumers and solidifying its cultural presence. The company has opportunities to expand its business model through strategic collaborations, technological innovations, and a clear brand narrative.

## Highlights

- When itâ€™s really good, content conveys a message, elicits emotion, references culture or adds to it, and it can absolutely bring a brand to life, _along_ with everything else that a brand does (retail experience, packaging, products, brand codes, customer service, marketing activations, creative partnerships). Editorial - no matter how polished, and no matter who is in front of or behind the camera - lacking the bigger story is just a short-lived attention play.
- Business _longevity_ is rooted in the small, synchronized, and the consistent: a long-standing relationship with multiple generations of creators; diverse, varied, and well-defined consumer base; versatile and compelling content; and a curatorial angle (more on this below).
