## Summary

The key to winning in chess and startups is to avoid making blunders. Blunders significantly impact game outcomes, with players committing more blunders losing the majority of the time. Startups can also fail due to preventable blunders, such as not understanding customer needs or launching too early.

## Highlights

- The way to avoid mistakes is to be conservative and keep the ball in play, letting the other player have plenty of room in which to blunder his way to defeat, because, being an amateur, they will play a losing game and not know it.
- Your path [should consist of “or’s,” not “and’s.”](https://longform.asmartbear.com/capturing-luck/)
- Tolstoy opens Anna Karenina by observing: ‘All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’ Business is the opposite. All happy companies are different: each one earns a monopoly by solving a unique problem. All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.
- Shipping crap, and never shipping, are both blunders.
- Also, don’t “launch.” No one cares except your friends, and you’re going to have to reliably and consistently get customers for the next three years anyway, so just work on that.
- Coders like to code; everything else is hard, and not fun, and unclear how to execute, and costs money, and it’s so comfy to just sink back into the comfort of Visual Studio and marvel at the prescience of Copilot and tweak a CSS class.
