## Summary

Nutter Butter embraced a unique and bold social media strategy that initially felt uncomfortable but ultimately led to viral success. By committing to their unconventional approach, they created engaging content that resonated with audiences, significantly increasing their followers and views. The brand’s journey highlights the importance of persistence and trusting audience instincts in social media marketing.

## Highlights

- The problem that bedevils organizations once they reach a certain size is that narrow, conventional logic is the natural mode of thinking for the risk-averse bureaucrat or executive. There is a simple reason for this: you can never be fired for being logical. If your reasoning is sound and unimaginative, even if you fail, it is unlikely you will attract much blame. It is much easier to be fired for being illogical than it is for being unimaginative. The fatal issue is that logic always gets you to exactly the same place as your competitors.
- To me, the takeaway for your brand should not be to create some wild conspiracy theory on your account with ominous videos. The takeaway is bigger than that. It’s that brands (and bosses) should stop cutting good social ideas short just because they don’t immediately find an audience. Like Aubrey said, trust your followers’ intelligence and their ability to pick up on what you’re doing—and, importantly, give them enough time to do so.
