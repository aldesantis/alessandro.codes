## Summary

Brands need to focus on product innovation, not just branding, to stay competitive. Successful brands like ON Running and Skims prioritize quality products and engaging storytelling. Emphasizing product value over excessive branding layers is key in today’s market.

## Highlights

- “From the end of WWII until the introduction of Google, the gangster algorithm for shareholder value was simple — create an average, mass produced product, infuse it with intangible associations, and reinforce those associations through cheap broadcast media. [Then came] ‘brand’ which was a new kind of pixie dust that offered an exceptional lifestyle to average business people. Believers in the advertising industrial complex would be blessed with sacrosanct margins despite products void of differentiation.”
- These examples share a core strategy: **research into core consumer needs and simply brilliant, yet concise, ways to put it’s product value on display**. They then link these products to cultural moments, launching them at precisely the right moment. Where many brands get it wrong is when they pile on so many “brand” layers that the product itself gets lost in the shuffle.
- When every brand is working with the same creatives, selling in the same stores, and employing the same ‘brand’ tactics, it becomes crucial to focus on what sets their products apart. Then, they must communicate that value proposition effectively by placing it in a cultural context that resonates with the current reality of their target audience.
