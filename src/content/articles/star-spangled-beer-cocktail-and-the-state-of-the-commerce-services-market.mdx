## Summary

This text discusses the state of commerce consultancies and the changing landscape of commerce services providers, focusing on the shift towards composable solutions like Shopify and BigCommerce. It highlights the challenges faced by traditional implementers and the opportunities for engineering-focused providers in solving complex business transformations. The author suggests that successful commerce consultancies will need to adapt to increased complexity in digital business processes to thrive in the evolving market.

## Highlights
- For all its focus and talk about ‘ecosystem’, Shopify is in many ways disintermediating the commerce service providers in the process. Instead, larger consultancies are building ‘run’ practices to support clients on the platform, which requires few engineering or ‘product’ resources.
