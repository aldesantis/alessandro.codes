## Summary

Amazon’s dominance in e-commerce is unlikely to be challenged, as it covers the key axes of selection, low prices, and fast delivery. However, there are areas where Amazon falls short, such as supporting small businesses and offering curbside pickup. Shopify is a viable alternative to Amazon for small businesses, as it powers e-commerce stores and doesn’t create demand. Walmart is using its physical stores to fulfill online orders, while TikTok is trying to create a social commerce market. Chinese companies like Shein and Temu, which are vertically integrated and breaking out of the Amazon sandbox, are disrupting the e-commerce market.

## Highlights

- The significance of “What’s not going to change in the next five to ten years?” is two-fold: many new things are transitory, and the fundamentals that support long-term bets are reusable; they don’t become obsolete.

- Amazon has so little meaningful competition that it doesn’t feel forced to innovate.

- if the conversation is about retail, Amazon could almost be an afterthought. However, e-commerce and marketplaces begin with Amazon.
- Fulfillment and logistics are the foundation of Amazon because Amazon doesn’t sell goods. It sells goods that ship in one to two days and, for some shoppers, same-day.
- That one change transformed this from Amazon-specific to omnichannel. Amazon now runs two-tiered warehousing. The first tier is Amazon Warehousing Distribution (AWD), which was introduced in 2022. It is for long-term storage and is meant to resupply fulfillment warehouses. The second is Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA), which was both for warehousing and fulfillment when launched in 2006 but, over time, morphed into exclusively fulfillment as Amazon pushed for faster inventory turnover.

- TikTok’s shopping funnel is unique. Amazon, Walmart, eBay, and the rest of the shopping marketplaces in the U.S. are well-understood problems with known inputs like advertising spend, conversion rate tracking, listing optimization, and the like. They have the typical discovery, consideration, and purchase funnel. TikTok is none of those things. Nor is it a replacement or competitor to Amazon and the rest. TikTok Shop is a content problem.
