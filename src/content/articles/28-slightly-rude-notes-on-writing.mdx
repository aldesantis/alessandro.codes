## Summary

OR: catapulting myself into a pit of tarantulas

## Highlights

- All emotions are useful for writing except for _bitterness_.
  Good writing requires the consideration of other minds—after all, words only mean something when another mind decodes them. But bitterness can consider only itself. It demands sympathy but refuses to return it, sucks up oxygen and produces only carbon dioxide. It’s like sadness, but stuck eternally at a table for one.
  Other emotions—anger, fear, contentment—are deep enough to snorkel in, and if you keep swimming around in them, you’ll find all sorts of bizarre creatures that dwell in the depths and demand description. Bitterness, on the other hand, is three inches of brackish water. Nothing lives in it. You can stand in it and see the bottom.
- All writing about despair is ultimately insincere. Putting fingers to keys or pen to paper is secretly an act of hope, however faint—hope that someone will read your words, hope that someone will understand. Someone who truly feels despair wouldn’t bother to tell anyone about it because they wouldn’t expect it to do anything. All text produced in despair, then, is ultimately subtext. It shouts “All is lost!” but it whispers “Please find me.”
- making art is painful because it forces the mind to do something it’s not meant to do. If you really want to get that sentence right, if you want that perfect brush stroke or that exquisite shot, then you have to squeeze your neurons until they scream. That level of precision is simply unnatural.
- The beauty ain’t in the necklace. It’s in the neck.
- Maybe that’s my problem with AI-generated prose: it’s all necklace, no neck.
- Most writing is bad because it’s missing a motive. It feels dead because it hasn’t found its reason to live. You can’t accomplish a goal without having one in the first place—writing without a motive is like declaring war on no one in particular.
- This is why it’s very difficult to teach people how to write, because first you have to teach them how to care. Or, really, you have to show them how to _channel_ their caring, because they already care a lot, but they don’t know how to turn that into words, or they don’t see why they should.
- When you learn something about a writer, say, that Rousseau [abandoned all of his children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Jacques_Rousseau), it inflects the way you understand their writing. But even that isn’t quite the right example—it’s not about filling in the biographical details, it’s about realizing that the thing you’re reading _comes from_ somewhere. Good writing is thick with that coming-from-ness.
