## Summary

Training with the dual n-back task may improve working memory, but it often does not lead to increases in overall intelligence or cognitive abilities. Many users report personal benefits, like faster thinking and better memory, even if IQ test scores remain unchanged. Overall, results vary, and while some find it enjoyable, the effectiveness of these brain training games is still debated.

- [Working memory is important stuff⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory#Learning) for learning and also just general intelligence.⁠[⁠10⁠](https://gwern.net/dnb-faq#fn10) It’s not too hard to see why working memory could be so important. Working memory boils down to ‘how much stuff you can think about at the same time’.
- More seriously, working memory can be useful since it allows one to grasp more of the structure of something at any one time.
- The thing is, multiple monitors, touch-typing, speed-reading⁠[⁠17⁠](https://gwern.net/dnb-faq#fn17) - they’re all about making the external world part of your mind.
