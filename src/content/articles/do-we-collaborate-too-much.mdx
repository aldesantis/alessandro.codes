## Summary

Are we collaborating too much? Or too little? Both—because most of what we call collaboration isn’t actually collaboration at all.

## Highlights
- • ***Generative collaboration*** happens when we’re all part of the initial act of creation: writing in tandem, pair-programming, sketching on a whiteboard, building a schedule for the offsite in real time.
  • ***Reactive collaboration*** happens after initial creation: the creator solicits feedback on her creation in order to improve or validate it.

- Teams often fall into the trap of assuming asynchronous collaboration is more efficient than synchronous. We look around the meeting, add up everyone’s salaries, and say, “Do you realize how much this meeting is costing us?” But we rarely consider the trade-off: how much we’ll spend debating on Slack, writing and commenting on docs, escalating when that results in angry disagreements (because those happen on Slack), and ultimately scheduling even *larger* meetings to resolve those disagreements *and* the related interpersonal issues.
