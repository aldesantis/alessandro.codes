## Summary

Credit card rewards programs use fees paid by businesses to incentivize customers to spend more. Different regions have varying levels of rewards based on card acceptance costs. Card issuers compete for high-spending customers by offering rewards and benefits.

## Highlights

- The more a card product is pitched to socioeconomically well-off people, the more expensive interchange is. Credit card issuers _explicitly and directly_ charge the rest of the economy for the work involved in recruiting the most desirable customers.
- Interchange functions as a subsidization of the cost of credit throughout the economy by businesses which want to sell things to people who would use credit to buy things.
- One key difference that credit card program managers have to understand: a source of advantage for frequent flyer miles as a pseudocurrency is that they can turn very-low-marginal-cost inputs, unsold seats, into very-high-perceived-marginal-benefit outputs, “free vacations”.
