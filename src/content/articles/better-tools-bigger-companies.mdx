## Summary

The text discusses the rise of Techno-Industrials, emphasizing that with better tools, tech companies are poised to reshape large industries and tackle significant challenges. It highlights the trend of combining various technologies to create vertically integrated solutions that can disrupt traditional sectors and lead to the emergence of $100 billion+ businesses. The author argues that the convergence of atoms and bits in Techno-Industrials will drive more value and wealth creation compared to traditional software companies in the coming decade.

## Highlights

- One of the biggest innovations in fintech has been _getting rid_ of physical bank branches. Crypto’s innovation is getting rid of the banks altogether. Once the rough edges are smoothed out, getting rid of middlemen means structurally superior unit economics.
- One definition of deep tech is that there’s more technical risk, but less market risk – or, if you build it, they will come – which means that more energy can be directed towards simply building it versus constantly adapting to changing market dynamics.
