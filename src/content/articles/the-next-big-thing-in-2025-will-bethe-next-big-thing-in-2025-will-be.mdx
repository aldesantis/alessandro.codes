The next big thing in 2025 will be...

## Summary

In 2025, the rise of AI agents will transform how we interact with technology, allowing these tools to handle complex tasks autonomously. There will be a shift towards AI becoming a seamless part of our daily lives and business operations. This evolution will lead to new user interfaces and a focus on human curation in a world saturated with AI-generated content.

## Highlights
- Agent startups, after proving initial value with narrow use cases, will be forced to expand into traditional SaaS territory - building workflow tools and moving deeper into systems of record to capture more customer value and prevent churn. Meanwhile, SaaS platforms will aggressively integrate their own agent capabilities, leveraging their existing customer relationships and data. The key tension: agents need to get sticky, while SaaS needs to stay competitive.
- The next big thing in 2025 will be AI for the mainstream rather than for the tech-progressive. The vast majority of people don't care about model benchmarks, they care about relevant use cases that improve their lives. The best AI products will be the ones that real people use.
- The next big thing in 2025 will be top AI talent shifting from working in the companies pioneering the latest and greatest AI to taking leadership roles in the industries that will benefit most from AI.
- The next big thing in 2025 will be the rise of "cognicos," [companies with an AI-native cognition-driven stack of technologies](https://www.implications.com/p/the-cognition-stack-for-ai-native), with data and compute at the center, and humans playing the unique role of stewards and orchestration designers and engineers as nodes.
- The next big thing in 2025 will be the return of the product oriented founder. The magic of AI technology that led to instant PMF for so many companies is starting to wane.
