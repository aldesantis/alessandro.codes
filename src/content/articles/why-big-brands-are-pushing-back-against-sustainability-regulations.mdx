## Summary

Fashion companies argue proposed government mandates for greater supply chain transparency are ‘impractical.’ They shouldn’t be, writes Kenneth P. Pucker.

## Highlights

- Notwithstanding advances in technologies including blockchain, smart sensors, isotope identification and supply chain mapping software, many industry participants maintain that it is “next to impossible” to know which suppliers are growing their cotton, tanning their leather and dying their fabrics.
- Fashion is one of the world’s most environmentally damaging industries, with impacts spanning chemical, land and water usage, as well as carbon emissions. Trends are not positive. Predictions estimate that plastic polyester fibre production will [increase](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-fashion-industry-environmental-impact/?sref=fnjoKOAK) by 47 percent in the next decade while carbon emissions from fashion are on track to [grow](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/fashion-on-climate) by 30 percent.
- According to a European Commission study, more than half green claims by companies in the EU were vague or misleading, and forty percent were completely unsubstantiated.
