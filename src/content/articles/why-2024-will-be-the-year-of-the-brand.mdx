## Summary

2023 saw several fashion industry failures that highlighted the importance of brand identity. Farfetch, Allbirds, and Amyris all suffered setbacks due to their failure to build a cohesive brand identity. In contrast, brands like Abercrombie and Chanel have successfully revitalized their reputation by updating their image and connecting with consumers on a deeper level.
