## Summary

CMOs are taking on more responsibilities, including new tasks related to generative AI, but many feel unprepared due to limited resources and support. A McKinsey survey shows that while brand building is a priority, most marketers lack confidence in their company's ability to succeed in this area. Key challenges include internal silos, budget constraints, and a shortage of talent, which could hinder brands from seizing new opportunities.

## Highlights
- Brand building, a function traditionally handled by CMOs, remains a top priority, and has [seen something of a bounceback in 2024](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/marketing-campaigns-first-half-2024/719805/) after an overswing toward lower-funnel performance marketing over the past several years.
