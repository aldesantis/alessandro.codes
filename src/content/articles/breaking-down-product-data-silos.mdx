## Summary

Why Your Team is Doing Low-Value Work (and How to Fix It)

## Highlights
- Each team interacts with product data from a unique perspective. The ecommerce team needs attributes that optimise product discovery and search, merchandising cares about how products are categorised for inventory and budgeting, and product development might require technical specifications that support manufacturing and quality control.
- Rather than overloading product categories with endless sub-levels, focus on a lean hierarchy with only the essential top-level categories. Aim to keep the hierarchy “skinny” by limiting levels to broad groupings that can be applied across all departments—think “product type,” “category,” and, if necessary, “gender.”
