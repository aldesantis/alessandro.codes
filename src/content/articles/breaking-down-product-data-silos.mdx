## Summary

Why Your Team is Doing Low-Value Work (and How to Fix It)

## Highlights

- Each team interacts with product data from a unique perspective. The ecommerce team needs attributes that optimise product discovery and search, merchandising cares about how products are categorised for inventory and budgeting, and product development might require technical specifications that support manufacturing and quality control.
- Rather than overloading product categories with endless sub-levels, focus on a lean hierarchy with only the essential top-level categories. Aim to keep the hierarchy “skinny” by limiting levels to broad groupings that can be applied across all departments—think “product type,” “category,” and, if necessary, “gender.”

# Breaking Down Product Data Silos

## Metadata

Author: [[Luke Hodgson]]

Tags: [[ecommerce]] [[erp]] [[retail]]

## Summary

Ecommerce teams often spend too much time on low-value tasks due to fragmented product data across different systems. By breaking down data silos and fostering cross-functional collaboration, brands can streamline data management and focus on high-impact work. This approach leads to better product discovery and improved customer experiences, ultimately driving growth.

## Highlights

- By bringing together representatives from each team to form a “**product data squad**,” brands can create a unified approach to data that respects each team’s needs while promoting a more seamless data flow. This squad doesn’t just establish initial standards; it plays a continual role in managing and updating data structures, making it easier to keep hierarchy lean and attribute management flexible across departments.
