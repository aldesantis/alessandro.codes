## Summary

In the age of AI, software creators are emerging as a new creative class, similar to content creators. This shift democratizes software creation, leading to a variety of creators making software for different purposes and audiences. Software creators will focus on concept, creativity, and distribution, making software more accessible and diverse.

## Highlights

- Software creators will make _software for consumption_ too. Their products will deliver short-term value, they’ll be intentionally ephemeral – a flash-in-the-plan or one-hit wonder as a feature, not a bug. We’ll see a lot more _software as art_, _software as a game_, _software as an experience_ — not just software as a never-ending utility.
