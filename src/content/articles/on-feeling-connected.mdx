## Summary

generosity is potency

## Highlights
- When I give of myself, when I genuinely care about others, I generate a feeling of connection, a feeling that is closely related to love. This is a feeling we often long for. And it is common to think it is something we must *receive*—that to feel a connection, we must find someone who sees us and who cares about our authentic self. But what people who see giving as an act of potency realize is that this feeling of a loving connection is *something you can produce yourself*.
- Look at people on the train and remind yourself that they have an entire world inside their head—and feel how a sense of connection flows from you. You can do this with animals, too, and plants, and objects, and ideas. Pay attention to things as if they are too big to fit in your head—and feel love seep out of you. Do small acts of kindness and don’t take credit. Care more than necessary.
