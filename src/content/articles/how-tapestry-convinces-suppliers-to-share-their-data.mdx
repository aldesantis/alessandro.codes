## Summary

Tapestry, a fashion company, is working on tracing the origins of its raw materials to meet regulatory requirements and increase transparency. They have partnered with TrusTrace to streamline the process and onboard suppliers onto a traceability platform. Building trust with suppliers and improving relationships across the supply chain are key priorities for Tapestry.

## Highlights

- in 2023, for the first time in Fashion Revolution’s Transparency Index, more than half (52 per cent) of brands disclosed their Tier 1 suppliers.
- Marshall agrees that brands looking to build relationships with Tier 2, 3 or 4 suppliers should be hands-on, rather than relying on each supplier to incentivise their own suppliers. She also adds that for training to be effective, it’s important for brands to ensure they’re not being patronising.
