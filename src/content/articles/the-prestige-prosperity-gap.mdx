## Summary

In the modern world, there is often a mismatch between prestige and wealth, with some being prestige rich but cash poor, and others being cash rich but prestige poor. This phenomenon can lead to practical and emotional challenges, causing stress and cognitive dissonance. People may struggle with the idea of having more of one aspect relative to the other, prompting a need to decide how to navigate the pursuit of prestige and wealth.

## Highlights
- Plenty of people are *prestige rich, cash poor*. And plenty others are *cash rich, prestige poor*.
- Startups, especially the recent era of aggressively venture-backed startups, are a hotbed for this kind of thing too. Founders, employees, and small investors of hyped-up startups often find themselves prestige rich, yet relatively cash poor. Some have given up on their bets ever translating to real wealth, while others are still holding out hope for their stock options to become liquid, i.e. turn into cash.

- Wealth used to be the predominant avenue for influence in a society, but this is no longer true. *Credibility, access, attention* have been decoupled from money to a tangible extent.
