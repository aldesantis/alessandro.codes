## Summary

Subscription boxes are essentially products built on the principles of marketing arbitrage: you set a price, you buy a customer, and you count on the lifetime value of the customer exceeding the cost of that acquisition.

## Highlights

- Subscription boxes are essentially products built on the principles of marketing arbitrage: you set a price, you buy a customer, and you count on the lifetime value of the customer exceeding the cost of that acquisition.
- In what could be seen as the latest wrinkle in the subscription commerce sector, Blue Apron said Monday (Nov. 7) that meal kits that stick to a subscription-only model could be losing valuable customers, including those who make purchases from the brand every week.
- for many retailers without proper unit economics, the model appears to have run its course, proving that subscription is best as an added function and not the entire pitch.
- The proliferation of the model has illustrated that there has to be a value that surpasses the ease of shopping through eCommerce apps. The products have to be unique enough to outlast competition. And the products have to have the right price incentive or lack of availability elsewhere. If you can buy it from Prime and have it within the hour, the subscription value proposition may not be enough to convince a consumer that automation is superior to the convenience and variability of the instant needs industry.
