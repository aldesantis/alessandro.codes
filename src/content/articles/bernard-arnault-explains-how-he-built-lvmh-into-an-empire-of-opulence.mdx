## Summary

Bernard Arnault built LVMH into a luxury empire by acquiring top brands and focusing on opulence. He believes in combining luxury brands to strengthen them and attract high-end consumers. Arnault's ambitious vision includes expanding into real estate and potentially acquiring more luxury companies in the future.

## Highlights
- “You have people all over the world, in countries plugging into the global economy, making a lot of money, getting significantly richer and needing reassurances that they are now in a better position,” says Luca Solca, an analyst at Bernstein. “This is the deep-seated insecurity that luxury is trying to address.”
