## Summary

First principles thinking can fail when you reason correctly from true axioms but miss important facts or the right level of abstraction. Even rigorous, logical analysis can give wrong conclusions if you start from the wrong set of true principles or lack key information. The only real test is whether your conclusion works in reality.

## Highlights

- you can build analyses up from base principles … only to end up at the wrong level of abstraction. This is one way to fail at first principles thinking.
