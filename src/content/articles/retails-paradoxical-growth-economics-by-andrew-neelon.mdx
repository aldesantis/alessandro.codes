## Highlights
- A former colleague and now industry friend used to bucket prospective locations as “commerce vs cool.” For example, King Street in Alexandria was “cool” (up and coming cool brands opening) while Tyson’s Corner was “commerce” (highly trafficked, but run-of-the-mill mall).
- Here’s why that matters: malls are expensive. If your rent on a street locations is $50psf, it’s probably $100psf at the mall in the same market. The rent typically includes “extras” such as CAM, real estate taxes, etc. Malls also want to ensure your buildout is up to their standards, and will end up holding you to higher design standards as a result — which means more expensive buildouts.

- The first few locations for any brand tend to be cheap. In part because they find spaces that are “move-in ready,” and in part because they buy shelving and tables off the shelf at places like Target and Container Store.
  But as four things happen…
  Fewer new locations are “move in ready” and consequently require more investment
  Mall landlords are generally not okay with IKEA and Container Store “fixtures” or shelving
  Brands want to upgrade their location from a vibe that gives off “startup” and temporary to “grown up” stores with a standardized and elevated point of view
  Store openings are much more rapid, and teams can’t uniquely curate every single detail of every single location
  …brands are inevitably forced into (1) standardizing and (2) elevating their store designs. This includes everything from shifting from your local friendly painter to a nationwide provider, investing in custom millwork ahead of time, hiring architects for technical drawings, and many other things — much more expensive things.
  As a point of reference, you can build a popup for $50,000 easily if you find the right space in the right condition, and only use Container Store “fixtures” and shelving. But that cost can get as high as 10x when you try to build it in a quality mall.
