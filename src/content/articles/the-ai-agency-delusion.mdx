## Summary

WPP’s vision of AI in agencies promises endless speed, scale, and personalization but overlooks the messy, slow parts of creativity that make work original. Relying too much on AI risks producing predictable, shallow outputs and losing what makes creative work meaningful. The real challenge is balancing AI’s power with preserving human friction to protect the soul of the work.

## Highlights

- But creativity has never been a smooth-running machine. It’s a field littered with false starts, inexplicable leaps, the sudden click of something that didn’t make sense for weeks. The moments worth having are often bought by the hours worth wasting.
- A thousand algorithmically tuned micro-variants of an idea do not necessarily add up to a bigger cultural footprint. In fact, they can fragment the impact, creating a blizzard of “almost-right” executions, none of which land with the force of a singular, culture-shaping concept.
- when every message is personalised, nothing feels _shared_. The great campaigns of the past worked partly because they gave us common reference points. Personalisation done without a unifying narrative erodes those points of connection, leaving only isolated, forgettable fragments.
