## Summary

These days, I find myself getting more and more transparent about, well, everything, as if I were Pat Flynn. Last week, I discussed a semi-fictional gig, but with realistic prices.

## Highlights

- I’m not exaggerating when I say that I’ve lost track of exactly how many clients have offered me salaried positions. No interview, no nothing. Just “I’d start you running X department next week if you’d take the gig.” As much as I’d like to think this is because I’m some kind of singular corporate genius, I know that’s not true. It’s because I’ve supplied a tiny island of competence in a sea of ineffectiveness.
- When you’re a short timer, you have the cachet that I described in my “[always be leaving](https://www.daedtech.com/always-be-leaving/)” post. But once you agree to stay, indefinitely, the luster wears off. Gradually, at first, but then insistently.
