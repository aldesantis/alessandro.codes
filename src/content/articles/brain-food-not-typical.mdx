## Summary

The challenge isn't knowing you should work out; it's putting on your shoes and running in the cold when you'd rather sit at home under a warm blanket.

## Highlights
- The hard part isn't knowing what to do; it's doing it daily, whether you feel like it or not.
- The most practical skill you can learn is working smarter. But here's what nobody tells you about working smarter: it often looks like you're working slower.
- Your first thought is what everyone else thinks. Your best thought comes after you've thought long enough to forget what everyone thinks. The difference between good and exceptional isn't hours worked – it's the depth of thought applied to the right problems.
