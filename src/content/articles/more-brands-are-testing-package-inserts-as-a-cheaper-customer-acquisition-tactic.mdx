## Summary

Brands are increasingly using package inserts, which are ads included in product shipments, as a cost-effective way to reach new customers amid rising digital advertising costs. These inserts target specific audiences, such as subscribers to meal kits, and can lead to higher engagement compared to traditional ads. While measuring their effectiveness can be challenging, many companies see inserts as a valuable addition to their marketing strategies.

## Highlights

- Compared to direct mail ads, Smith said there are some draws. “Since the brand doesn’t pay for postage, you get a piece of mail into someone’s hands for dramatically less than direct mail,” he said. For context, he explained, if direct mail costs $0.40-$0.60 per piece, inserts would cost about $0.05 to $0.08 cents, depending on the program.
