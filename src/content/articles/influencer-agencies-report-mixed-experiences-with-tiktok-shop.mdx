## Summary

Influencer agencies are having mixed experiences with TikTok Shop, as the program continues to grow on the platform. While TikTok Shop is seen as an appealing new channel for brands to partner with creators, there are still issues with the tech infrastructure and onboarding process that are preventing some creators from joining. Despite this, TikTok Shop saw success during the holiday season, with many creators and sellers publishing shoppable videos and live streams, resulting in millions of new customers making purchases. However, marketers still find the suite of tools challenging to use, and there are concerns about counterfeit goods and pricing. Overall, TikTok Shop has the potential to be a new standard for social commerce, but improvements are needed for it to succeed.

## Highlights

- According to creator agencies, TikTok Shop is an appealing new channel for their clients to partner with brands. However, snags like issues with the tech infrastructure and a tedious onboarding process are still preventing some creators from joining TikTok Shop’s growing stable of affiliates.
- Krishna Subramanian, founder and CEO of Captiv8, an end-to-end influencer marketing platform, said that thus far the agency has found TikTok Shop to work best for small online brands — which have the ability to test agile creator campaigns and see what works.
