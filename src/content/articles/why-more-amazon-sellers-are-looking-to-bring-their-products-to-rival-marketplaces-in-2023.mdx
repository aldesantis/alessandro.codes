## Summary

Amazon vendors are extending to rival marketplaces to diversify and make sure they are present across different channels.

## Highlights

- [A recent survey](https://www.capterra.com/resources/amazon-holiday-fulfillment-fee/) published by Capterra, a division of Gartner, revealed that 99% of small and medium-sized retailers that currently sell on Amazon intend to sell on other e-commerce marketplaces next year.
- Amazon discourages sellers from listing their products for less elsewhere.
- Ultimately, Hensell said, for some merchants Amazon is the right fit when it comes to fulfillment and shipping expenses. “When you shake out the expenses for those, Amazon often ends up looking like a pretty decent deal,” she said.
