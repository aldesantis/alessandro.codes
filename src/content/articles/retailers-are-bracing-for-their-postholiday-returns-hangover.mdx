## Summary

After rushing to sell goods, merchants are facing the flip side: “We’re heading for a trillion dollar problem here.”

## Highlights
- With the added shipping, warehousing and labor costs, Inmar estimates it costs merchants about $27 to handle a return for a $100 online order. Gartner’s Enright said companies lose some 50% of their margin on returns when accounting for the cost of initially selling the item plus processing the return.
- Reverse-logistics company Pollen Returns estimates about 30% of all returned items are resold. Things that do make it back to shelves are often discounted because they are no longer in season.
