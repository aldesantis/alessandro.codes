## Summary

The text argues against morning yoga, daily routines, and endless meetings to focus on high-impact “10x work” tasks in one’s career. It emphasizes the importance of identifying and prioritizing tasks with significant upside potential, breaking free from routine to embrace serendipity, and proactively positioning oneself for pivotal moments. The key takeaway is to shift focus from routine tasks to opportunities for high-impact work and strategic career moves.

## Highlights

- People are often focused on the defensive practices to free up more time — canceling 1:1s, blocking off time, “no meeting Thursdays.” These are necessary but not sufficient. The question is, how do you decide what to prioritize in this free time? How do you pick tasks that will have true upside, not just defend our calendars better?

- Serendipity loves randomness and hates routine. This is why I’m so positive on sending outbound emails to interesting people, hosting dinners and events that bring together smart folks, and publishing any and all thoughts online. There’s often followup, and opportunities present themselves randomly.
- Find time to invest in your comparative advantage, because it’s another non-linear asset to compound over time. It’s not enough to just be competent at what you do — learn its history, and figure out where it’s going next. Teach, critique, and discuss. Explore and define the next frontier. Become the best at the one specific thing, or top 25% at two or more things.
- For the long tail — remove/delegate/automate the \<1x work. If it doesn’t matter much if it’s done well or not, then just get it done. There’s so much written about this that I won’t dive into it much here. This is the “playing defense” part.
