## Summary

There are 16 result possibilities and each takes into account BOTH where you’re at in your business & your dominant personality traits (this beast took hundreds of hours to create and is the ONLY personality & growth assessment built for creators that’s intentionally designed to support you no matter your stage of business, industry, or experience.

## Highlights

- A lot of your growth will come from a small number of outlier hits.
- Even though growth happens suddenly (even randomly) you have to consistently operate in a manner that creates that opportunity.
  Consistency helps you get better.
  Consistency helps you take more shots on goal.
  Ultimately, it’s that consistency that creates the opportunity for a spike.
