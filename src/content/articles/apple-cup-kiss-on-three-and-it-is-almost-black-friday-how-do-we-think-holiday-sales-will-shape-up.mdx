sales will shape up?

## Summary

It is almost Thanksgiving and ‘Black Friday’ - the traditional kick-off of the holiday shopping season.

## Highlights

- The real story is that e-commerce continues to grow at a strong pace, and now on a much larger base than before the pandemic. So the media narrative that e-commerce has slowed somehow is just plain wrong - and I suspect may be twinged with generational bias and yearning for a return to “offline ad revenues” that kept media afloat and profitable until digital came in and stole the turkey… and the cranberry sauce.
- Net-net, commerce tech and services businesses need to realize that the retailers and brands they serve may remain in a relatively conservative mood after the holidays. While sales may be decent, margins will likely not. Those running retail and DTC businesses may be inclined to continue to optimize around the edges.
