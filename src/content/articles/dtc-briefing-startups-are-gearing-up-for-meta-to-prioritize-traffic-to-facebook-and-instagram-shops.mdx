## Summary

Some media buyers are reporting that Meta is directing more traffic to Instagram and Facebook Shop’s, instead of a brand’s own DTC website

## Highlights

- The transition to Shops is also just one of many challenges DTC brands have to contend with in regards to Meta right now. Multiple people said that the reps they used to work with were let go in Meta’s multiple rounds of layoffs over the past year, which makes escalating issues to the right person more difficult.
