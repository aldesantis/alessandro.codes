## Summary

Walking is a vital, yet often overlooked human activity in modern society. Authors and philosophers emphasize the benefits of walking for physical and mental well-being, creativity, and deep thinking. Walking offers a unique perspective on the world, promotes a fitting scale and speed for human experience, and can be revolutionary in countering societal pressures.

## Highlights

- In an old post about the distinction between the tourist and the pilgrim, I once [noted](https://thefrailestthing.com/2012/06/06/the-pilgrim-and-the-tourist/) that the tourist bends the place to the shape of the self while the pilgrim is bent to the shape of the journey.
- The world is not simply present to us in its fullness and depth by virtue of the fact that we are capable of glancing at it. Instead, if we are to see the world, we must attend to it with care, patience, and even love.
