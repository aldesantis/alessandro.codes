## Summary

Google has decided to keep third-party cookies in its Chrome browser, reversing earlier plans to phase them out. This shift comes amid regulatory pressures and feedback from the advertising industry, raising concerns about consumer privacy. While some see this as a win for advertisers, others worry it undermines efforts to build trust in digital advertising.

## Highlights

- “This news isn’t surprising. They likely don’t want to do anything that would potentially hurt their ads business if they are ultimately forced to sell Chrome,” said Amelia Waddington, global chief product officer at search intelligence firm Captify, in emailed comments. “Sandbox worked because it was based on them owning Chrome and having complete control of the supply chain. If they don’t have Chrome, they will need cookies for targeting, just like everyone else.”
