## Summary

To receive a standing ovation as a conference speaker, thoroughly prepare and script your talk instead of improvising. Use engaging stories and clear, well-structured slides to connect with your audience. Lastly, focus on confident delivery and maintain eye contact to keep the audience engaged.

## Highlights

- The key to avoid such embarrassment is to actually prepare your talk, and that means, and I’m sorry about the bad news, _writing it down in its entirety_ before even thinking of delivering it.
- The best way to get an ovation at the end of your talk is to make the audience feel alive, and stories are a great way to do that. This is because we humans love stories. Use anecdotes from your real life (but remember to anonymize them, ok?) and couple that with the technical concepts you need to talk about.
- Organize your talk (your story) following the proverbial 3-step framework:
  1. **Introduction:** tell us what you’re about to say.
  2. **Body:** tell the audience what you want to say, and repeat yourself many times along the way. “Don’t Repeat Yourself” or “DRY” is good for your code but terrible for your conference talks. Redundancy in storytelling is actually a good thing.
  3. **Conclusion:** repeat the core idea to the audience at the end.
- If you must give a demo (something quite common in tech circles), **record your screen as a video and play it back during your session.** The “demo gods” are more often than not in bad mood, and the chances that your demo will go wrong are outstandingly high.
- Once you have the script, you can start preparing the slides. Do not inverse these steps. Remember: first the script, then the slides.
- If for some reason you need to put lots of text on a slide (for example, when quoting a famous author, or some research paper), remember that most people are able to read by themselves, but here’s the kick: they do it best in silence.
  So, if you have lots of text on a particular slide, **let the audience read that long text in silence: which means, stop talking for a few seconds.** Take that opportunity to drink a sip of water, and to take a deep breath. Do. Not. Read. The. Slide. Capisce?
- So, face the audience. Have no fear. Look at them in the eyes. Smile. Pan your gaze across the audience while you speak, from left to right and back to front. They came to hear you talk. They want you to talk to them. You have to convince them of your arguments.
- That moment of silence helps your core ideas to sink into the minds of the audience. They give _gravitas_ to your ideas. They make them memorable. Then repeat the same concept again. Scan the room and the audience with open eyes while you repeat those ideas.
- Pay attention to your body language and **stop moving around the stage.** Choose a spot and stay there. Stand straight. Raise your forefront. Breathe deeply. Raise your eyebrows. Smile.
