## Summary

The new merchandising strategy focuses on understanding who to sell to, where to sell, and how to market products effectively. It emphasizes the importance of creating a diverse product portfolio that appeals to different audience segments and retail contexts. By mastering product desirability and discoverability, brands can enhance their marketing efforts and drive sales.

## Highlights

- To be desirable, a product needs social and cultural capital. To be discoverable, a product needs to stand out in terms of design (brand codes, graphic design, visual language), zeitgeist (novelty, trends, emerging aesthetics), or wear (who wears it, how is it worn, where is it worn).
- Product portfolios are one of the three components of merchandising programs. The other two are retail contexts and audience segments.
