## Summary

Many smart founders fail because multiple factors must align for a startup to succeed, and the failure of just one can be fatal. The Startup Drake Equation highlights key risks to address, like ensuring there’s a product people want and establishing a solid customer acquisition process. By focusing on high-risk areas first and designing around weaknesses, founders can improve their chances of success.

## Highlights

- The galaxy produces many warm leads, but every step of the conversion funnel is brutally leaky, so it’s hard to convert to a sale.
- Even better than “different,” is to be extreme in that difference. Not just a minimal UI, but so minimal it works on the command-line. Not just great design, but so remarkable people buy it only for that, and it’s written up on designer’s blogs. Not just a new algorithm that solves an old problem, but one that uncovers new things that no one else does, even at the expense of missing things that others catch.
- You must select low-risk markets that are easy for you to address. You could pick a different word than “easy”—lucrative, growing, profitable—but I like “easy” because it keeps things personal. Do you think it will be easy? If so, you’re wrong—it will be harder than you think, but still possible. Whereas if you already think it will be difficult, it’s also worse than you fear: impossible.
- If you start with low-risk tasks you’ll surely succeed, but the high-risk tasks remain unresolved, and remain high-risk. Nine months later, when you finally tackle the high-risk areas, you might discover the entire venture is unworkable.
- As an executive once quipped to me twenty years ago, explaining why a new product line had failed: It was a platform portability problem—we couldn’t port it from PowerPoint to Java.
