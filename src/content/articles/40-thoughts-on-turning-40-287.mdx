## Summary

In his reflections on turning 40, Paul Millerd emphasizes the importance of embracing change and pursuing what truly matters, even if it feels slow and confusing. He shares insights on work, success, and relationships, highlighting the value of self-employment and defining success on one’s own terms. Millerd also discusses the joys and challenges of parenting, stressing that meaningful experiences often come at the cost of other pursuits.

## Highlights

- Following what truly matters means you must walk away from parts of yourself that you love and parts of yourself that others love. This can be quite the roller coaster of emotions.
- “The moment” when people take bold action is often a post hoc fabrication. Real change is slow and confusing
- Having an impressive job or career is the easiest way to run from both your inner world and outer world responsibilities while still being seen as a respectable adult.
- Five years into a happy marriage I understand why it’s hard to give advice on relationships. Everything is unique to the little world that you build with this person. So perhaps the best advice is to find someone who you are excited to world-build with.
- “Have you tried doing less on the problem?” is an underrated strategy to get unstuck. Most people try to do more.
