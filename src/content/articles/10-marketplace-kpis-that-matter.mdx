## Summary

Marketplaces are incredibly powerful. They are taking every aspect of our economy by storm and changing how goods and services are discovered, priced and delivered.

- Is your marketplace a few-to-many or a many-to-many platform? If it’s few-to-few you may not have a business as the need for a middleman is reduced. Many-to-many marketplaces like Etsy bring the most value to a market and are best positioned to defend themselves against disintermediation.

- **LTV/CAC** is essentially the ROI generated by acquiring an incremental user. While benchmarks for various verticals exist, you should typically desire a >1–1.5X 1-year LTV/CAC and a >3X 3-year LTV/CAC
