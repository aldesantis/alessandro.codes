## Summary

You heard it here—a Nietzschean pronouncement for the quartermark of the 21st century.

## Highlights
- In Pascal’s time, diversions had a rustic charm: hunting, gambling, maybe a polite duel before dawn. Now, they’ve been industrialized, optimized to death, and wrapped in friendly UX. Pascal’s diversions were human nature; ours are human nature with venture capital backing.
- Instagram didn’t invent the need to be seen. LinkedIn didn’t originate the craving for validation. The same dynamics play out at dinner parties, job interviews, and in those little mental highlight reels you run before falling asleep. Logging off isn’t a rejection of the system—it’s just a different way of opting in.
