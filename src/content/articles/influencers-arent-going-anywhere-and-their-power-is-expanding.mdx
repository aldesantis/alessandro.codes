## Summary

Most Gen Z adults follow influencers on social media, with many seeking their advice on various topics like fashion, health, and news. This trend shows that influencers are becoming important sources of information and are influencing real-life conversations among young people. Additionally, many Gen Zers want even more influencer content in the future, highlighting their growing impact.

## Highlights
- Almost all Gen Z adults (88%) report following at least one influencer on social media, and nearly 1 in 4 (22%) report following more than 50. These figures are both double-digits higher than what is reported by the general population.
- Gen Z adults also report actively seeking out information and advice from online influencers at much higher rates than all U.S. adults. Media recommendations, dating, and fashion and beauty are among the topics where these gaps are largest.
