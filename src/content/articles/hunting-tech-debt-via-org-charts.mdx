## Highlights

- A bonus is nice, but feeling secure in your job because the role you’re playing and the decisions you’re making are in line with what the organization prioritizes is much more powerful.

- The true operations of systems are determined by the day to day decisions of individuals on the ground. Those people are going to prioritize the work that helps them get ahead. The activities at the bottom of that list are where tech debt is going to accrue.

- People need trust in order to collaborate. Once an organization is greater than about 150 people, the ability of the individuals in that organization to trust each other based on direct, personal experience breaks down. Trust needs to fall back on something else and it tends to fall back on hierarchies and process.

    - Note: This seems to imply that a small group can work without structure insofar as the group’s members trust each other, which doesn’t seem to be the case (see “The Tyranny of Structurelessness”).
