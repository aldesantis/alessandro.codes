SEO in an AI world: first draft of a strategy

## Summary

For the last month, I have been advocating the need to develop a new SEO approach to generative AI, and now that I have had a chance to experiment with Google’s SGE, I have more thoughts on what that strategy might look like. My approach will continue to evolve as I experiment with SEO in AI, so this is a work in progress. Additionally, it is still very early in Google’s own journey into generative AI within search and how AI and search mix will continue to change. I have noticed that AI responses have stopped appearing on some queries it did before and then it comes back.

## Highlights

- Query reporting will be obsolete as a metric for SEO success. Instead, you will need to focus on revenue from organic search as a KPI with clicks as a leading metric.
    - Tags: [[search]] [[marketing]] [[seo]]
- Note, that in a query-less world, impressions and click-throughs will matter a lot less. Impressions will not be an accurate measure of visibility because users might not even scroll past the generative box if it answers the question. Clickthrough rates will be highly volatile as on precise queries it will be high while on broad queries it will be close to zero.
