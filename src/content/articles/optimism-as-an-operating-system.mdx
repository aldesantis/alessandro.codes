## Summary

The text discusses the importance of maintaining a positive attitude as a consultant and focusing on identifying the strengths and systems that work within an organization. Building enduring client relationships involves understanding clients as ecosystems in balance and blurring the boundaries between professional and personal interactions. Success as a consultant comes from bringing energy and enthusiasm, solving problems, and creating routine solutions to important issues for clients.

## Highlights

- If you walk in the door with a problems-focused mindset ready to criticise the client you’ll get rejected by the organization like a bad virus.
- Remember - **consulting is humans all the way down** - no client wants to bring in a negative, critical or attacking consultant. And no team wants to listen to a consultant that _“has a better way of doing things”_.
- The strongest language you have as a consultant is:
  _“this is a solvable problem”_
- And yet - it’s humans all the way down and if you want to be effective in the theatre of work you need to recognize and participate in both the front-stage and back-stage environments of a client’s office.
- Show up in the back-stage of the theatre some-times but not all times. It’s important to give teams the opportunity to retain their identity and you shouldn’t overwhelm them.
- **Although clients will rarely pay for it directly there is value in changing the energy and changing the conversation in an organization. These are precursors to real change**. And if you provide this level of positivity and optimism then clients will keep you around irrespective of your “impact”.
- **the key when engaging clients is not to hunt for problems but to hunt for systems**.
  It took me a long time to learn this - that strengths and weaknesses are not in opposition to each other but rather they are in symbiosis.
