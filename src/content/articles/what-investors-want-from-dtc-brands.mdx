## Summary

Cautious investors are finding safer bets in tech-focused platforms that create products for online brands over traditional DTC start-ups.

## Highlights

- Simply selling a product online directly to consumers is not enough to attract investors, especially as many e-commerce brands are unprofitable with slowing sales growth. Desirable start-ups today have technology more deeply embedded in their business models, using data to create the exact type of product consumers want and to personalise the online shopping experience.

- The standard for valuations right now is anywhere between two and five times projected revenue, one investor in consumer brands said, but Blanka’s credentials gave it a leg up.
- The brand lets customers vote on the colours they launch on its online store, and voting consumers who eventually purchase the product are issued an NFT version even if they don’t have an existing crypto wallet. When Kiki World starts selling in multi-brand retailers, customers with NFT versions of a nail polish will be able to earn a percentage of that colour’s sales, said Jana Bobosikova, Kiki World’s co-founder and CEO.
