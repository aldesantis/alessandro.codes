## Summary

Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook, is launching an ad-free tier for users in Europe. This move is seen as a way to comply with regulations like the Digital Services Act. However, users who choose the ad-free experience will have to pay a monthly fee, which could generate significant revenue for Meta. Ad-free models are becoming more popular as users seek uninterrupted content and prioritize privacy. Other platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ have also introduced ad-free options. The success of Meta’s ad-free tier in Europe may determine if it will be introduced in the US.

## Highlights

- Interestingly, younger social media users don’t seem to mind advertisements as much as was once thought, and recent research shows users’ growing comfort with personalized ads.
