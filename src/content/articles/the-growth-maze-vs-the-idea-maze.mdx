## Summary

The AI landscape is shifting from focusing on the “Idea Maze,” which involves finding the right product idea, to the “Growth Maze,” where companies must navigate strategies for scaling and distribution. As AI technology evolves, it will influence how startups approach both product development and growth strategies, creating new opportunities and challenges. Successful businesses will need to master both mazes to thrive in the competitive AI market.

## Highlights

- A good idea means a bird’s eye view of the idea maze, understanding all the permutations of the idea and the branching of the decision tree, gaming things out to the end of each scenario. Anyone can point out the entrance to the maze, but few can think through all the branches.
- Unlike the Idea Maze, which you traverse by adding and removing features, the Growth Maze is traversed by iterating on new go-to-market initiatives and making decisions about the above. You might target new audiences. Or the choices might involve hiring, or length partnership discussions, or a combination of product iteration with growth intentionality.
- It is in the mid/late parts of the S-curve that simply working is not enough. When you try your 5th messaging app, the magic has worn off. After a few years of “mobile-first startups” we just dropped the mobile-first moniker and went back to calling them startups.
