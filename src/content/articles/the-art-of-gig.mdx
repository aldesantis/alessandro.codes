## Summary

An individual named Ben Bean receives a frantic call about a potential inventory crisis at a consulting firm. He quickly takes charge, utilizing strategic moves and manipulative tactics to navigate the situation. The arrival of a powerful figure from McKinsey adds a new dynamic, leading to further tension and strategic maneuvering among the team.

## Highlights

- Because if there’s one skill people invariably pick up on their way to the Executive Suite, it is the alertness to _never_ take point on a situation that they do not have the freedom to define*.*
- in strategy consulting, the _greater_ the quantity of resources you deploy into an engagement, the lower down the hierarchy you go. Pyramids are bottom-heavy, so resources are not necessarily an advantage, since they need a certain amount of pyramidal _breadth_ to operate within. They get you _in_ quicker, but they weigh you _down_ later.
  The guy who gets control of narrative is often the guy operating with just a whiteboard, right at the top. No Big Data. No spreadsheets. No PowerPoint.
  Just a man and his whiteboard, armed with nothing more than a germ of a 2×2 in his head. Consulting in all its elemental rawness.
