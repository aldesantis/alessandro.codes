## Summary

US retail sales stayed steady from May to June, but concerns about a potential recession are growing due to rising unemployment and increased consumer debt. Some fashion companies like Ralph Lauren are performing well, while others like Capri Holdings are struggling. Overall, consumer spending is cautious, as shoppers are affected by broader economic conditions.

## Highlights

- On Thursday, J.P.Morgan put the probability of a recession at 35 percent, up from a previous assessment of 25 percent, citing the slowdown in American job growth and the global stock sell-off.
- More American shoppers have fallen behind on their credit card payments, resulting in a record high in collective debt: $1.14 trillion, according to a Tuesday report from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
- US retail sales remained stable from May to June, Census data showed last month, and reflected a 2 percent increase from June 2023. A number of fashion companies, in fact, are holding strong or even posting growth in the face of external volatility.
- The uneven performance shows that while consumers are still buying fashion, they are judicious in how they are parting ways with their money.
- “The US economy is in an indecisive mood. Some indicators are pointing negative, but others remain robust,” Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, told BoF in an email statement. “Consumers see this too, which is why sentiment has been very changeable.”
