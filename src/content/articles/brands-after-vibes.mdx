## Summary

Brands today are increasingly defined by “vibes” rather than unique stories or identities, influenced by AI and social media trends. This shift means that consumers often connect with brands more through emotions and perceptions than through traditional branding strategies. To succeed in this vibe-driven world, brands may need to focus on creating tangible value and distinctiveness that stands out amidst the noise.

## Highlights

- This video declares that the age of brands as stories has ended. There are no more ninety second spots that tell a tale, he argues, now there’s only vibe, something more like sentiment or affect – what’s picked up in a crowded feed, two or three seconds between footage of catastrophic climate change and a monkey who’s learned to do makeup tutorials. He gives the example of a Twitch stream: it may be too hectic to read the individual posts, but you can monitor the sentiment. You can catch the vibe. You can see if it’s your vibe or not. You can vibe it out.
- **Brand as story** is the other conventional frame that’s been very popular, as mentioned in the Tiktok that kicked this off. This one is all about using things like narrative structure and the hero’s journey to structure the way a brand shows up and communicates, and also using stories as branding opportunities. Brand “lore” is an updated subset of brand as story.
- **Brand as pattern** is about creating something that shows up iteratively in the world, rather than repeating messages rotely. This has classic examples, like Absolut ads, and more mimetic ones, where users take on the pattern and create the brand themselves (something that comes up often in conversation with Nemesis’s more decentralized clients).
- **Brand as interface** is from the theorist Celia Lury, who wrote [Brands: the Logos of the Global Economy](https://www.routledge.com/Brands-The-Logos-of-the-Global-Economy/Lury/p/book/9780415251839?srsltid=AfmBOop-tb-Z_EzOjZn2dE49A0oc8vEUsKFJ0RHpC0VT96adwCFsrMbV). She describes how brands are a way of interacting with the global economy in a way that goes beyond the rational order of price alone, introducing all these other elements – soft and hard – that stand in for sheer price and utility.
- “When we talk about a strong brand, what we mean is that it consistently delivers the emotion it promises. The most successful brands, or at least the ones everyone emulates, have the knack for using design to produce an emotional coherence that spans from content to product to experience. Think Apple or BMW or Chanel. Not everything has to look alike, but it all has to feel alike. Whenever we encounter them we get that familiar brand sensation. That tingling tells you it’s working.”
- Robin James [builds on this work](https://itsherfactory.substack.com/p/is-a-vibe-the-same-thing-as-a-style) to clarify that “algorithms aren’t perceiving styles or genres. They’re perceiving vibes, where the alignment among data points matters more than the contents of that data”. More significantly, she argues that vibes are “a way for people to perceive themselves and their world the way algorithms perceive things.”
