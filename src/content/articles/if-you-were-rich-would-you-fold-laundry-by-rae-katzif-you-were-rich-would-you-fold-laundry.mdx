If you were rich, would you fold laundry?

## Summary

The author reflects on the challenge of balancing work, household tasks, and personal pursuits, questioning the modern belief that menial tasks like laundry can be minimized or outsourced to focus on more lucrative activities. Drawing from personal experiences and advice from a former colleague, the text explores the idea of dividing life into three essential components: paid work, life maintenance, and personal creative endeavors. The narrative challenges the notion that optimizing time solely for work is fulfilling, suggesting that allocating equal attention to these three aspects could lead to a more balanced and meaningful life.

## Highlights

- Two dedicated hours each day for completing the tasks of living. It sounds both completely reasonable and utterly impossible.
- An ideal is emerging for me, a triad of types of work: The work you do to get paid, the life maintenance tasks like laundry, and the creative things you do for you. The economy-oriented work, the basic needs work, and the soul work, each of which brings something different to a full life. Three legs that create a solid foundation.
- The work we are prone to consider menial is foundational to a life, and I am suggesting a narrative where these tasks offer a break from other, more fast-paced modes of living, requiring a different type of energy and offering different rewards.
