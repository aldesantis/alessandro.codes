## Summary

Resilience is the ability to face challenges and grow from them instead of being overwhelmed. People who are resilient often believe they control their own fate and see adversity as a chance to learn. These skills can be learned and strengthened over time by changing how we think about difficulties.

## Highlights

- Frame adversity as a challenge, and you become more flexible and able to deal with it, move on, learn from it, and grow. Focus on it, frame it as a threat, and a potentially traumatic event becomes an enduring problem; you become more inflexible, and more likely to be negatively affected.
