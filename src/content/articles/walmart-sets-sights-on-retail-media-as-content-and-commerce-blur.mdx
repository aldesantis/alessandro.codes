## Summary

Walmart is considering acquiring Vizio, a smart TV maker, for over $2 billion to enhance its advertising business and compete with Amazon in the streaming media space. This move reflects the growing importance of consumer data and targeted advertising for major retailers to stay competitive. With Amazon’s strong presence in shoppable ads and streaming services, Walmart aims to leverage Vizio’s technology to offer targeted advertising on Vizio TVs and adapt to the changing landscape of retail and media where entertainment and commerce converge.

## Highlights

- Consumers are open to shoppable moments being integrated into their media-viewing routines. The same report noted that 1 in 3 connected device owners reported that they would be interested in the following internet-connected buying experience: “You are watching your favorite livestreamed series on your iPad or mobile device, and you want to buy an item of clothing or piece of jewelry that you see on one of the actors in the series. You are able to touch the screen to go to the product page and make the purchase.”
