## Summary

Amazon’s same-day and next-day delivery is widening the gap between it and the rest of e-commerce.

## Highlights

- Amazon’s bet is that faster shipping is behavior-changing.
- Fast delivery is not a linear improvement; the difference between two-day and same-day is structural for the retailer and behavior-changing for the shopper.
- Amazon doesn’t sell goods. It sells goods that ship in one to two days and, for some shoppers, same-day. [The logistics are as much part of the product as the products themselves.](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-sells-fast-shipping-not-products)
