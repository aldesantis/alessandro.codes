## Summary

The author discusses the importance of agency and taste in achieving high-impact work. Successful individuals take accountability for their goals and focus on finding effective solutions, often through data analysis and reflection. Developing a good intuition for impactful projects requires practice and a willingness to learn from experiences.

## Highlights

- People who can be trusted to make something inevitable are really rare, and are typically the bottleneck for how many different things a team or company can do at once. So if someone else is responsible for making your project inevitable, you’re consuming some of that scarce resource; if you’re the one making your own projects inevitable, you’re a _producer_ of that resource, and you’re helping unblock a key constraint for your team.
