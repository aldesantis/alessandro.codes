## Summary

Weeknotes are quick, flexible summaries of a team’s weekly work that help improve communication between team members and stakeholders. They encourage teams to share updates and insights while developing a habit of regular reflection. Writing weeknotes can be simple and effective, allowing everyone to contribute and stay informed without overwhelming readers.

## Highlights

- With teams able to broadcast, there’s suddenly a whole new axis for internal communication - genuine communication, directly between teams. Communication that flows naturally sideways, across the organisation. Not filtered up and down the hierarchy. Weeknotes help news and knowledge spread further, with minimum effort.
- In my experience, silos are inevitable and unavoidable. They’re a consequence of team-based working. They exist in almost every organisation, and destroying them - even “breaking them down”, which is the stereotypical way of talking about this task - is pretty much impossible.
- **Weeknotes turn remembering into a deliberate act**.
