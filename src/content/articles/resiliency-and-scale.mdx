## Summary

Centralization at massive scale has made systems less resilient, whether it’s Amazon’s US‑East‑1 or global supply chains centered in China. What should be diversified in theory became concentrated in practice because scale and cost won. Fixing it will be costly and require rebuilding capacity and redundancy.

## Highlights

- Rare earths are not, in fact, rare, but China’s scale and the inertia of the last forty years has led to total dependence on a country that is a geopolitical foe of the United States. And so, once again, removing or reducing the costs of transportation and communication — this time for atoms — did not increase resiliency but rather, thanks to the pursuit of lower costs enabled by scale, destroyed it.
- I am, needless to say, much more optimistic about our willingness to accept the costs of moving some bits around than I am the willingness to accept the drastically larger and longer costs of moving atoms. If we don’t, however, then we need to be clear that the true price being paid for global efficiency is national resiliency. Pursuing the former led to the destruction of the latter; there’s no way back other than destroying some value along the way.
