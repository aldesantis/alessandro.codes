## Summary

Tom Critchlow explores the concept of “small groups consultancy,” emphasizing that collaboration and informal discussions can lead to effective problem-solving. He suggests that a small group can create action and strategy without needing a traditional consultant’s expertise. Critchlow raises questions about which problems benefit from this approach and how it can be structured.

## Highlights

- It might be possible to help with strategy without providing original thought or even active facilitation: To consult without consulting. The answers and even ways of working are inherent in the group itself.
