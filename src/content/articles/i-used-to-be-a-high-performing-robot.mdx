## Summary

The author, Cate Hall, shares her journey of learning agency, which is the ability to make choices and change one’s life. She emphasizes that agency is not the same as success and can be developed by anyone at any age. Through her struggles with addiction and dissatisfaction, she discovered that true freedom comes from recognizing all available options in life.

## Highlights

- I consider the state of addiction to be the opposite of agency. Agency is the ability to recognize all of the degrees of freedom one has. Addiction strips them away, reduces life to one option, and subordinates everything else in service of making sure that option is selected over and over again.
- It had never occurred to me that the quality of my experience was both critically important and significantly malleable.
