## Highlights

- Product sense is the skill of consistently being able to craft products (or make changes to existing products) that have the intended impact on their users.
- Product sense relies on (1) empathy to discover meaningful user needs and (2) creativity to come up with solutions that effectively address those needs.

- I’ve learned that if you remove from your product lots of small annoyances that people deal with on a daily basis, the value you get from doing that adds up to something meaningful.
