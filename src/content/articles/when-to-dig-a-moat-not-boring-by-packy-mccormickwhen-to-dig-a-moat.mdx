When to Dig a Moat

## Summary

Uncertainty, Success, and Defensibility

## Highlights

- In _[Productive Uncertainty](https://reactionwheel.net/2020/11/productive-uncertainty.html)_, Jerry Neumann wrote that “the only moat that can create excess value for a new startup is uncertainty” because “uncertainty keeps competition at bay long enough for a moat to be built.”
- The more obvious your idea is and the easier it is to build, the faster you need to dig moats. Conversely, the less obvious your idea is and the harder it is to build, the longer you have to dig moats.
- Whether you should spend all of your time on product or spend some of it on strategy, even at an early stage, is a function of how much uncertainty exists in your business.
- Novelty Uncertainty is the kind faced by a lot of deeptech companies: uncertainty over whether you can actually build what you say you’re going to build.

- Complexity Uncertainty assumes that you can build it, but questions whether there will ever be a big and profitable market for it.
- New startups have a limited window of time during which they’re protected by the cover of uncertainty to dig moats, and if they don’t dig them by the time others catch on, their excess profit will be competed away and they’ll struggle to achieve a good outcome.
- Non-obvious ideas can become obvious as the market catches up to your insight and customers prove you right with their wallets. Things that were once hard to build can become easier to build as infrastructure improves. One company’s core technology can become another’s API.

- the easier it is for you to raise money, the more immediately you need moats.
- This is why strategy is important for startups, even if it’s uncool. At its simplest, **early stage startup strategy is about directing limited resources towards digging moats before you’ve removed enough uncertainty to attract serious competition.**
