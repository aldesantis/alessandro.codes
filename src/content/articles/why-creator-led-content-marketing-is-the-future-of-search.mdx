## Summary

The era of creator-led search is set to reshape how we approach SEO, content marketing and digital PR efforts. Here's how we can embrace it.

## Highlights
- Users are looking for content that is focused on them, speaking directly to them authentically and genuinely. One way in which brands can achieve this is by demonstrating experience within their content.
- Not only can creator-led content marketing be effectively deployed to gain visibility upon the emerging perspectives feed, but significantly, that content contributes to brands achieving their SEO goals upon the normal SERP.

- Work with certain influencers to develop initial awareness content before moving to different creators who are perhaps more suited to the latter stages of the journey.
