## Summary

Large language models (LLMs) cannot create new knowledge but help experts by quickly summarizing existing information. They work best when used by people who understand the topic well enough to ask good questions and spot errors. To use AI wisely, focus on its strength in combining known facts and keep humans in control of making meaningful decisions.

## Highlights

- The AI systems we have now are tremendously sophisticated and powerful, but they’re still information synthesis machines operating on the output artifacts of many generations of humans making inherently subjective decisions about what things are valuable — outputs of thousands of years of human meaning-making.
- LLMs work best for people with intermediate expertise — those who know enough to ask good questions and spot problems, but not enough to make the tools redundant. It’s a narrow sweet spot.
