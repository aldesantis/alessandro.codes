## Summary

Fame used to be rare but is now common and almost necessary to succeed in many areas. People seek fame not just to stand out, but also to fit in and avoid falling behind. As more people become famous, it gets harder to keep attention, making fame both easier to get and harder to sustain.

## Highlights

- Fame is a by-product of awareness and attention, and hence it’s zero-sum.
  If more people have fame, then on average each has less of it. But there’s still the allure of being the extra special standout.
