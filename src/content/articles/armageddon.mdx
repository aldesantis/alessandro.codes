## Summary

There are over 10,000 nuclear warheads worldwide, and one mistake could cause devastating destruction. More countries with unstable leaders and poor communication increase the risk of accidental nuclear war. Despite the danger, nations rarely talk or reduce weapons, making the threat worse over time.

## Highlights

- We evolved brains that could manufacture warheads before they could outgrow their tribal impulses. Humanity is experiencing a timing error between technology and biology.
