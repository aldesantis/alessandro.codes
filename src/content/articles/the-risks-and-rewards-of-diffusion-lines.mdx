## Summary

Diffusion lines have emerged as a core element of New Luxury as brands establish more accessible and (often) more popular collections than mainline.

## Highlights

- The most significant benefit of diffusion is an expanded market reach. By offering products at reduced price points–see £490 Georgio Armani jeans vs. £190 Emporio Armani jeans–brands expand their consumer accessibility, allowing a reduced buy-in for customers unable to afford the cost of mainline luxury.
- Introducing a diffusion line poses the risk of distorting a brand’s market positioning and established identity. Similarly, this may lead to an assumption that the diffusion line bears lower quality due to the reduced price point, ultimately “cheapening” the brand.
- Finally, offering a cheaper alternative to buying into a popular brand builds the potential of the cannibalisation of sales, as existing consumers may buy into the diffusion instead of the mainline as a more affordable option. To combat this, brands must establish a degree of separation between the mainline and diffusion through finishes, graphics, colourways, et cetera.
