## Summary

ON is a rapidly growing sneaker brand known for its unique design and strong emotional connection to movement. The company focuses on building a loyal customer base through community engagement and creative partnerships, rather than traditional advertising. Despite its success, ON still has the opportunity to enhance its cultural strategy and further connect with consumers.

## Highlights

- This currency is especially relevant now that brands are consumed with everything else in culture: movies, music, art, entertainment, experiences, content, photography, design … ). They have to participate through cultural products in all these different areas while staying true to their [overarching cultural narrative](https://andjelicaaa.substack.com/p/cultural-programming). This participation lends brands cultural credibility.
- ON’s promise to its customers to “move with us, and dream on.” “Dream on,” “move with us,” “ignite the human spirit through movement” are all uniquely runners’ sentiments and the general human feelings. The aspiration and broadness of this sentiment allows ON to play in theoretically infinite number of sports and lifestyle categories (right now ON offers road running, trail running, training, tennis, hiking and outdoor, and lifestyle).
- A lot of brands retrofit the emotion they want to be associated with later on ( Nike’s boldness, Puma’s joy, Adidas’ impossible is nothing), but ON made emotion the essence of product wear and the essence of its brand.
