## Summary

Henrik Karlsson shares how he generates interesting ideas through daily writing and conversations. He emphasizes the importance of curiosity and reflection, both alone and with others. By embracing his interests without judgment, he finds new paths for exploration and deeper understanding.

## Highlights

- Every day for maybe 7 years, I’ve written about what I think in detail, and the more I’ve done it, the better I’ve gotten at articulating what is new and interesting and meaningful in my thoughts.
- The best ideas tend to be fragile and can’t stand the scrutiny of others until they’ve learned to walk.
- I have more exciting ideas when I don’t feel shame about what excites me, when I allow myself to be stupid and naive and boring. I try not to judge myself in the act of giving birth to ideas.
