## Summary

This complete work-prioritization framework builds on the simplistic "Rocks, Pebbles, Sand" analogy, adding the details you need for the real world.

## Highlights
- **Hofstadter’s Law** 
  It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take Hofstadter’s Law into account.

- A Rock must deliver dramatic, measurable impact, not merely “incremental improvement.” It must be *strategic*, meaning that it must attack the most important challenges you face, materially advancing the company down its unique path for winning its corner of the market, leveraging existing advantages to reduce risk and to forge a path that others cannot easily follow, and build new durable advantages.

- Even if your ideas aren’t good enough, you will be tempted to select the most impactful idea on the list and just do it. This is a mistake. It’s such a common mistake, it is a cliché: [“Good” is the enemy of “Great.”](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/701885-good-is-the-enemy-of-great-and-that-is-one?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_medium=post) You have to [face the truth](https://longform.asmartbear.com/failure-to-face-the-truth/): Your biggest problem is a lack of a truly great idea, and you must solve *that* rather than embarking on a long, misguided journey.
- Agilists argue that if you find yourself part-way through a failing project, you can just abort, because “that’s agile.” That’s true, and that’s smarter than plodding forward in a [sunk-cost](https://blog.asmartbear.com/sunk-costs.html?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_medium=post) refusal to face reality, but on a human level it is demoralizing and ruins trust to abruptly cancel a project a team has been laboring on for months, “because we’re agile.” Canceling is necessary, but not free
- In bulk, Sand is mandatory for wonderful, high-quality software. When you use a piece of software and say, “Wow, this is really well-done,” that’s a result of Sand. While each grain is typically impossible to “measure,” ignoring them means we will never attain greatness, even with the best strategy.
- Administration is the biggest impediment to throughput, therefore PM’s must ruthlessly fight against the natural urge to debate and arrange and carefully assess and estimate the work, instead of just going about the business of completing the work.
