## Summary

The article discusses how our relationship with time shapes our career decisions. It identifies five types of time - micro time, engagement time, business time, strategy time, and big-thinking time - and suggests that our career choices should be optimized according to the timescale that we make the best decisions. The article also notes that job interviews are often overly optimized for quick-time decisions and suggests that companies should redesign job interviews to fit the decision-time of the job to improve hiring decisions. Finally, the article suggests that stimulants like caffeine can improve performance for people in micro-time and engagement time, while big-thinkers may benefit from downers like alcohol or marijuana to optimize for creativity.

## Highlights

- These are people who think fast on their feet. Most job interviews are geared toward people mastering this level of time. So many companies end up hiring people that fit this category even though making decisions in seconds is not core to most jobs. Redesigning a job interview to fit the decision-time of the job is very important and is an area where many companies can improve.
- Many big thinkers talk very slowly. When speaking, some mumble and have lots of ummmms. But they write very coherently.
- In my experience, people who fall into the long-time decision-making category often have the most profound conclusions…but also have a hard time changing their mind when they are wrong (likely because of the sunk cost of the work that went into making the decisions in the first place).
- The longer the timescale you are optimizing for, the more you should spend reading (and gathering information). The shorter your timescale, the more you should spend doing (for muscle memory).
