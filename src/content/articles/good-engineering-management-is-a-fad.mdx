## Summary

The idea of “good engineering management” keeps changing with business trends, so what was praised as excellent leadership can later be dismissed as a fad. Core skills like execution and growth skills like taste and working across timescales matter across eras, but their relative importance shifts. Manage your energy and career choices deliberately, because tradeoffs compound over a long career.

## Highlights

- **Working across timescales**: ensure your areas of responsibility make progress across both the short and long term. There are many ways to appear successful by cutting corners today, that end in disaster tomorrow. Success requires understanding, and being accountable for, how different timescales interact.
- the perfect allocation of work is not the mathematically ideal allocation that maximizes impact. Instead, it’s the balance between that mathematical ideal and doing things that energize you enough to stay motivated over the long haul.
