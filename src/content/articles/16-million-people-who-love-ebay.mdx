## Summary

eBay’s new goal is to “reinvent the future of e-commerce for enthusiasts.” It says it has 16 million of them.

## Highlights

- eBay now has a better articulated and narrower focus. It is not a replacement for Amazon and Walmart, and it offers more than its [vertically-focused competitors like Etsy and StockX](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/unbundling-ebay). It will still do [$34-35 billion in GMV](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/stats/ebay-us-gross-merchandise-volume-gmv) in the U.S. alone this year. However, that will be less than 2022, which was smaller than 2021. eBay’s GMV and active buyers will continue dropping before it finds a bottom and settles into its new role focused on enthusiasts.
