## Summary

Customers would see their points as a tangible pathway to getting more of what they love rather than a generic currency.

## Highlights

- In reality, consumers respond better to confidence in the choices presented to them over a bouquet of rewards all valued equally by the restaurant.
- in fact, research shows the reward claim rate for personalized rewards, optimized over the customer’s unique order history, is 3.5 times as high as one-size-fits-all rewards.
