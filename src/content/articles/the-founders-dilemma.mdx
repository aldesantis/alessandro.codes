## Summary

Some founders leave their startups early because their personal brand grows bigger than their company. This creates a gap where the founder feels bored or frustrated and wants new challenges. The rise of personal branding and social media is changing how founders think about loyalty and success.

## Highlights

- _when a founder’s personal power starts to exceed the power of their company, something shifts_. _They get anxious, frustrated, dissatisfied, bored._
- The definition of entrepreneurial success itself may shift from building lasting companies to building lasting personal brands — with the companies you build just part of your portfolio.
