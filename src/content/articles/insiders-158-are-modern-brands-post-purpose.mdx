## Summary

Alexa Lombardo discusses the shift in brand strategy from purpose-driven activism to focusing on authentic values and consumer alignment.

## Highlights

- In the past, consumers were seen as passive recipients of brand messages and products, but social media introduced active, conscious consumerism, turning customers into proactive stakeholders. This facilitated demands for new policies, practices, and investments in areas like corporate social responsibility, sustainability, and DE&I. All of a sudden, Purpose was THE thing.
- There is a difference between purpose-driven activism that is authentically engrained in the brand’s behavior and the table-stakes responsibility that comes with being a brand in 2023.
- Social and environmental **responsibility** is essential regardless of purpose, while **activism** isn’t for every brand. Taking a stance can solidify brand identity and _potentially_ increase brand value — if the activism is genuine and aligns with the brand’s core values and customer beliefs.
- While consumer expectations are a driving force behind brand activism, it is crucial for brands to approach activism thoughtfully and not try to force it into a purpose where it doesn’t belong.

- The era of performative branding is giving way to a demand for genuine commitment, and influencers are at the forefront, guiding and sometimes pushing brands into a future where they must truly embody their values.
- Without a values-based approach, brands may become exploitative, force-fitted, or culturally insensitive; resulting in the “ick” people feel when they witness a brand’s inauthentic attempt to infiltrate a subculture or trend.
- Stand for your purpose, don’t search for it.

- Values spoken or written mean nothing. Values in action are everything.

- > In a landscape where trust is fragile and scrutiny is high, a values-based approach to purpose and action can serve as a safeguard against accusations of inauthenticity and purpose-washing. It requires brands to be introspective, consistent, and genuinely committed to the ideals they espouse.
