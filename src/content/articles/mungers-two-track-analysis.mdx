## Summary

Charlie Munger’s “two-track analysis” involves considering both rational and subconscious influences when analyzing human behavior. This approach can be applied beyond stock picking to various aspects of decision-making, such as hiring and retention. By assessing economic and psychological factors, individuals can better understand human behavior and make more informed choices. Munger’s method highlights the importance of acknowledging cognitive biases and emotional influences in decision-making processes.

## Highlights

- After about two years of trial and error, I realised that retention was the result of six factors — five of which I could control. These six factors are best expressed as questions that all employees ask themselves (whether consciously or not):
  1. Am I given enough latitude in my day-to-day work? (Autonomy)
  2. Am I happy with my current professional growth rate? (Mastery)
  3. Is my compensation acceptable to me? (Compensation — in practice, this question usually breaks down to: “is my compensation sufficient for my current needs?”, and “am I being paid enough relative to my peers?”)
  4. Does work fit into my current life? (Work/life integration)
  5. Do I like the people I work with? Do I have good relationships with my coworkers? Do I have a good relationship with my boss? Does one make up for the other? (Relationships)
  6. How much do I believe in the company’s stated vision or purpose? (Mission)
