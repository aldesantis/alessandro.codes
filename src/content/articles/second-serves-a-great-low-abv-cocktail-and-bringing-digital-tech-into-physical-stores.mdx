## Summary

Issue №28 - How retailers and brands must step up their digital experiences in stores and across all channels, with a great low-ABV cocktail to pair with it - the Second Serve.

## Highlights

- About half of consumers reported switching brands in 2022, up from one-third just a few years before in 2020. What’s more, about ninety percent say they’ll keep switching. Absent truly differentiated, exclusive offerings, a retailer will soon become a utility - just a box, a means of distribution - and good luck with that; because then you are playing Amazon, Temu, and Walmart’s game.
