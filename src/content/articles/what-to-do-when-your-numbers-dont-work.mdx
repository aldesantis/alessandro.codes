## Summary

MacCoy Merkley is the CMO of Portland Leather Goods, where he started in 2018 as the brand’s first “digital media specialist” after responding to a Craigslist ad.

## Highlights

- I’ve met operators running $5M or $10M businesses with unhuman-like skill and discipline.
  And I’ve seen $500M+ brands run by folks with half the brain cells, mainly because they were in the right-sized category.
- When you have limited inventory at a lower cost basis than you’re likely to ever see again, you want to get the highest contribution margin.
