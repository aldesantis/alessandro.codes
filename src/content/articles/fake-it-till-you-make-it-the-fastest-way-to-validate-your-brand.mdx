## Summary

In reality, if over 90% of startups fail, you’d be a smarter gambler saying, “This business is probably going to die. ” At least then, you’d be right more often.

## Highlights

- So if I’m selling a $20 t-shirt, but I’m bidding against brands selling $5 tees and $100 ones, my auction gets broad, competitive, and expensive. A $2 CPC and $50 CPM might make sense for a premium brand with high AOV and cash to burn - but not for mine. Even if my product is better quality and delivers a better experience, Meta doesn’t know how to translate product quality or customer experience, it’s relying on your creative to do that. But naturally, everyone’s communicating that same message.
- _it’s never been easier to build a business—but never harder to build a profitable one_.
