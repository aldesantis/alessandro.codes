## Summary

Tactics of product-led branding

## Highlights
- In the product pyramid, Hero products have both the role of being the purest distillation of the brand creativity and innovation, a building block of a personâ€™s wardrobe, and a cultural product: a fodder for collaborations, a character, a social object, a bridge between the heritage and the present.
- Cultural products are created when a company *productizes* emotion around its products, retail, story, or community. It can productize associations, stories, history and intention behind the original items, innovation in design, materials, cultures, and contexts of wearing.
- In product-led branding, physical stores can be transformed into crafts workshops, like Golden Goose, does, where products are repaired, recycled, and customized. Ask: what can a physical store do that no other retail channel can? What does a physical store productize? Individual preferences? Wear stories? History? Creativity and innovation? All of the above?
- Key to success of temporary physical retail destinations is to have a strong and single-minded point of view. Miu Miu recently launched Summer Reads popups across the globe, offering only a selection of books. In its heyday, Glossier was known to have pop-ups with only one product. Pop-ups productize exclusivity, emotion, and community.
- *Online marketplaces* are the place to be. At the same time, they flatten and commodify all brands that do not have a superior and very recognizable product. Key is for product to speak for itself beyond the logo - through stitching, fit, design, colors, and other markers of creativity and innovation. Volume-drivers perform best here.
