## Summary

This admonition recurs in myriad books, frameworks, and topics, across decades of time. When something is so consistent, it must be wisdom.

## Highlights

- Once you start seeing the pattern of “failure to face the truth,” you see it everywhere. In almost every meeting, someone is thinking something and not saying it, even though one of the [best uses of a meeting](https://longform.asmartbear.com/productive-meeting-activities/) is to unveil and discuss insights. In every strategy discussion, there’s a monster in the room no one will name, even though the point of strategy is to identify and then construct a battle plan against the monsters.
- The truth is a courtesy; conversely, failure to face the truth is at least impolite, and at worst “ruinous” in Scott’s terminology, as when a manager withholds necessary feedback for fear of hurt feelings or being seen as unkind.
- Fluff is a form of gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts or arguments. It uses [non-specific or] esoteric concepts to create the illusion of high-level thinking.
- _Failure to face the challenge._ Bad strategy fails to recognize or define the challenge. When you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it.

- It’s hard to tell the truth to someone’s face. It’s hard to realize that your industry has completely shifted, and it’s _really_ hard to say that out loud in front of the whole company. It’s hard to say “no” to a customer when you have bills to pay, and it’s hard to make a major strategic choice, because what if you’re wrong?
