## Summary

The author discusses the benefits and challenges of using LLMs in programming, noting that they can handle tedious tasks and improve productivity. While some developers express skepticism about LLMs, the author argues that these tools can enhance coding efficiency if used correctly. Ultimately, LLMs can help clear away mundane work, allowing developers to focus on more important tasks.

## Highlights

- People complain about LLM-generated code being “probabilistic”. No it isn’t. It’s code. It’s not Yacc output. It’s knowable. The LLM might be stochastic. But the LLM doesn’t matter. What matters is whether you can make sense of the result, and whether your guardrails hold.
- Professional software developers are in the business of solving practical problems for people with code. We are not, in our day jobs, artisans. Steve Jobs was wrong: we do not need to carve the unseen feet in the sculpture. Nobody cares if the logic board traces are pleasingly routed. If anything we build endures, it won’t be because the codebase was beautiful.
- If you’re taking time carefully golfing functions down into graceful, fluent, minimal functional expressions, alarm bells should ring. You’re yak-shaving. The real work has depleted your focus. You’re not building: you’re self-soothing.
