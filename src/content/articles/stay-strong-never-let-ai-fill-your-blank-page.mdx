## Summary

AI can help overcome the fear of a blank page, but relying too much on it can weaken your creative thinking. Writing is a process where original ideas emerge, and using AI too early can short-circuit this process. To preserve your creativity, focus on your own thoughts before seeking AI assistance.

## Highlights

- AI short circuits the serendipity that leads to your best ideas.
