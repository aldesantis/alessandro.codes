## Summary

Welcome to another edition of Cocktails & Commerce.

## Highlights

- Seventy-four percent of Shopify’s revenue in 2024 came from Merchant Solutions in 2024 - which is primarily payments - while only 24% of Shopify’s revenues came from SaaS subscriptions in 2024 (much of that from enterprise Shopify Plus customers).
- As social commerce continues to grow, can Shopify bully its way into getting its share of the payments volume or while it slips-slide away? What if Amazon buys TikTok?
- Over the past five years, the total merchandise value (GMV) sold through Shopify has grown from $61.14 billion in 2019 to $292.28 billion in 2024 - nearly 380% growth over the five year period.
- Shopify’s own estimates claim it now has ~12% of U.S. B2C eCommerce running through its platform.
