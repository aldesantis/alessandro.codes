## Summary

What does it really feel for a founder to close their beauty brand? One founder speaks candidly about hope, identity, debt, and knowing when to move on.

- If you have hope, but you’re out of resources, you will find the next check. You will find a way to keep going. If you don’t have any hope, but you have resources, you just go into robot mode to keep charging through. But when you’re out of both hope and resources, that’s a really tough spot to be in as a founder, and it’s likely the time to shut down.
