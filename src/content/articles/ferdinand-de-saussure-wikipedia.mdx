## Summary

Ferdinand de Saussure was a Swiss linguist and philosopher who greatly influenced modern linguistics in the early 20th century. He is best known for his ideas on structural linguistics and the distinction between language and speech. Despite publishing little during his life, his concepts continue to shape the study of language and human sciences today.

## Highlights
- here is also his theory of a two-tiered reality about language. The first is the *langue*, the abstract and invisible layer, while the second, the *parole*, refers to the actual speech that we hear in real life.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure#cite_note-:1-30)
- One of Saussure's key contributions to semiotics lies in what he called *semiology*, the concept of the bilateral (two-sided) sign which consists of 'the signifier' (a linguistic form, e.g. a word) and 'the signified' (the meaning of the form).
- For example, in Saussure's notion, the word 'tree' does not refer to a tree as a physical object, but to the psychological *concept* of a tree. The linguistic sign thus arises from the psychological *association* between the signifier (a 'sound-image') and the signified (a 'concept').
- There can therefore be no linguistic expression without meaning, but also no meaning without linguistic expression.
- For example, natural law does not dictate which plants are 'trees' and which are 'shrubs' or a different type of [woody plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_plant); or whether these should be divided into further groups. Like blue, all signs gain semantic *value* in opposition to other signs of the system (e.g. red, colourless). If more signs emerge (e.g. 'marine blue'), the [semantic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_field) of the original word may narrow down.
- Within the same language, all words used to express related ideas limit each other reciprocally; synonyms like French *redouter* 'dread', *craindre* 'fear,' and *avoir peur* 'be afraid' have value only through their opposition: if *redouter* did not exist, all its content would go to its competitors.
- Saussure defined his theory in terms of binary oppositions: *sign—signified, meaning—value, language—speech, synchronic—diachronic, internal linguistics—external linguistics*, and so on. The related term [markedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markedness) denotes the assessment of value between binary oppositions.
- Perhaps the most famous of Saussure's ideas is the distinction between language and speech ([Fr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) *langue et parole*), with 'speech' referring to the individual occurrences of language usage.
- In Saussure's and Durkheim's thinking, social facts and norms do not elevate the individuals but shackle them.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure#cite_note-Klautke_2010-51)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure#cite_note-Hejl_2013-52) Saussure's definition of language is statistical rather than idealised.
- Saussure argues that language is a 'social fact'; a conventionalised set of rules or norms relating to speech. When at least two people are engaged in conversation, there forms a communicative circuit between the minds of the individual speakers.
