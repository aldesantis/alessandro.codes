## Summary

Some may call them Generation Z - but they’re not all of a particular generational group as you see some late teens to early thirties. You’ve heard of HENRY. Let me introduce you to CARLY: Can’t Afford Real Life Yet.

## Highlights

- Like HENRY the mall-goers in line at Crocs don’t have a generational affinity. They seem to belong to a psychographic group that:
  - Spends money they didn’t earn.
  - Participates in memes and socially sharable experiences.
  - Spends more time in public spaces.
  - Gets around in vehicles that they don’t own.
  - Celebrates irony as much as it does diversity.

- These collaborations are connecting with the very psychographic nature of audience segments like CARLY who are prone to align with brands based not just on the brands’ status amongst their peer group, but on how it makes them feel.
