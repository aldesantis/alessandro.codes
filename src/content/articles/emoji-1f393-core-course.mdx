## Summary

The text explains the Alexander Technique, which helps people stop trying too hard and instead allows them to act effortlessly. It highlights how this technique can transform one’s presence, like when Clark Kent becomes Superman. By learning to unlearn habits that hinder us, we can access our natural confidence and creativity.

## Highlights

- Alexander Technique lets you tap into something you’ve already experienced, but inconsistently. It’s the sublime moment when you throw something effortlessly – without thinking at all – and it lands precisely where you wanted. You didn’t think through everything you’re going to do. You didn’t consciously move yourself like your body is a puppet and you’re the puppeteer. Throwing just happened and it happened flawlessly.
- But what I’m saying is that you can try less hard while achieving even better results. I’m not talking about doing nothing at all. I’m talking about not wasting energy on things that not only don’t contribute to the full living of your life, but can actively harm it.
- “Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.”
