## Summary

Elliot Aronow discusses the shift towards more intimate, authentic relationships in the creator economy, moving away from parasocial dynamics. He challenges the reliance on data in a world that defies logic, emphasizing the importance of human intuition and critical thinking skills. Aronow also reflects on the complexities of encouraging men to open up emotionally, highlighting the need for safe spaces and alternative avenues for expression beyond just talking.

## Highlights

- I believe that we’ve hit peak parasocial relationships and that things are quickly trending in the other direction — brands and communities are now being built around _intimate_, live, offline focused crews, which blend physical and online spaces together.
- We’re obsessed with lagging indicator data and safe, trite narratives just because they can’t be disagreed with. It’s much easier to keep your job when you have the data to back you up.
- _This_ is the future of work skill, which no one wants to talk about: Knowing when to look beyond the data, because only human intuition, leaps of logic, and sense-making can come to ‘an’ answer. (Note: Not ‘the’ answer… that’s another trapping of computer-thinking. There is no “one” answer.)
- And in a moment when contradictions are a flight risk and cognitive dissonance is breaking our brains, holding — no, _seeking out and embracing_ — conflicting narratives is the skill of the future.
- Art isn’t as much leisurely entertainment, which it’s often perceived as and therefore cut, but rather, art is an opportunity to embrace ambiguity and hone the crafts of communication and interpretation. Art isn’t just pictures, songs or film, but a tool to self-reflect and express ideas which dialogue can’t always convey.
