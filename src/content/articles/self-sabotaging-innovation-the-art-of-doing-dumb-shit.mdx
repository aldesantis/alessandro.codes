## Summary

The text discusses how organizations often engage in self-sabotaging behaviors that hinder innovation. It highlights cognitive biases and a culture focused on metrics, leading to a lack of meaningful progress. To truly innovate, companies must embrace simplicity, encourage dissent, and prioritize genuine value over busywork.

## Highlights

- [Action Bias](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/action-bias) leads us to believe that doing something – _anything_ – is better than doing _nothing_, even when the action doesn’t actually move us forward. We equate busyness with productivity, mistaking motion for progress, and perceive novelty as innately valuable.
- The brain doesn’t exist to help us think.
  It exists to save resources, helping us to _not think_.
- We do things not because they work, but because everyone else is doing “it.”
  And when everyone else is doing “it,” those decisions evolve into “best practices.”
  But!
  Frequency ≠ Norm ≠ Success
  In fact, it’s likely the _opposite_:
  Infrequency ≈ Abnormal ≈ Success
- Why are we doing this?Who is this for?Does this matter to them?
  Too often, our drive for innovation is hollow — it’s about ticking boxes, posturing to an industry, and not being left behind.
- Play dumb. Require over-simplification in the recommendation. Request or provide a super basic answer to help strip jargon and complexity. If it doesn’t make sense to a five year old, it won’t ever make sense. Make _them_ realize _they_ don’t make sense.
- Give yourself two weeks and it will always take two weeks. Give yourself two days and it will take two days. If the Ancient Romans could decide the fate of empires in meetings which lasted no longer than the burning of a candle, surely we can discuss the team’s agenda in under an hour. Purposefully limiting time, curbs over-complexity and bureaucracy.
- Ask yourself, “Do I believe in the shit I’m selling?” If not, get back to work until you do. We spend too much time _pretending_ to care. We have to attempt to answer one of the most difficult questions, “Why is what you do important?” Let’s either work to find that answer, or work to change the output until that answer becomes clear.
