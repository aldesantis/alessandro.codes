## Summary

🤔 Need TikTok Shop Affiliates or UGC Creators to drive your sales? Tap into JoinBrands’ network of 500k creators ready to go.

## Highlights

- Branded clicks teach Google what a real buyer looks like. When brand volume drops, those signals fade and bid models destabilize.
- **Brand campaigns are the memory layer of your account.**
  They remind Google who buys, how they search, and what a profitable user looks like.
  Remove that and you force the system to perform without the very signals that trained it.
