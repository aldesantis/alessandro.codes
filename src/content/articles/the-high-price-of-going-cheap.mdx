## Summary

American shoppers love cheap products, leading to fierce competition among retailers. Companies like Shein and Temu are thriving by offering low prices that many American brands struggle to match, resulting in store closures and bankruptcies. Retailers must find ways to connect with customers beyond just price to survive in this challenging market.

## Highlights

- Most retailers don’t outright say that Shein and Temu are a problem for them. It’s not a great look to admit that you’re hemorrhaging customers because you can’t compete with e-commerce companies selling the lowest-quality, lowest-priced versions of everything you make. But if you read between the lines, the issue is present.
- “Shein and Temu are rock bottom of the market,” Mercer said. “If the whole market is rising in price, you can put your price up and still be rock bottom.”
- “You’re not going to be able to outcompete Shein or Temu on price, so you have to build that almost emotional relationship with” customers, Mercer said. “You have to stand for more than low prices.”
- Woloson noted that some people can’t afford to buy something nicer, but even if everyone could, it’s not clear they would. We live in an [era of flash fads](https://www.businessinsider.com/trader-joes-mini-tote-bags-stanley-cups-tiktok-consumerism-marketing-2024-3). People don’t want a $200 pair of jeans that'll last for a decade — they want a $20 pair they can toss when the next trend cycles through.
- At the moment, Shein and Temu are winning a race to satiate the insatiable American consumer, and they’re undercutting retailers big and small in the process.
