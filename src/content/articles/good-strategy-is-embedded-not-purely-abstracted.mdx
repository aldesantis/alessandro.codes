## Summary

Good strategy must be embedded in the everyday realities of an organization, rather than just being an abstract concept discussed in boardrooms. By understanding the actual dynamics of teams and their interactions, organizations can avoid misdiagnosing problems and implement effective solutions. This approach helps drive meaningful change and ensures that strategies resonate with those responsible for executing them.

## Highlights

- Good strategy can never be purely abstracted. It must be embedded in the mundane, everyday realities of an organisation.
- Strategy that _only_ makes sense in the boardroom is often bad strategy. Good strategy needs to be embedded so that it accounts for, makes sense to, and works with the different levels of the organisation. Embedded strategy recognises the importance of the mundane and the unsexy.
- Abstracted strategy is designed at the top, pushed downward, and resisted at every step.
