## Summary

I’m currently working on a couple of longer, more ambitious pieces of writing, so this week I’m deviating from the usual format.

## Highlights

- Writing is a method of paying attention to the experience of being alive.
- The feeling of being able to really stand behind what you’ve written — regardless of how it’s received — is one that’s worth a lot. I’ve learned this the hard way.
- My experience of these downloads is that they suddenly arrive from _somewhere_, and if I manage to capture them, they leave a scent trail that guides the rest of the piece along. I don’t know where they come from, but I always defer to them when they do.

- You can’t force your way through this problem and expect the writing to be good. Keep reading, keep talking, keep digging. You’ll know when you get there.
- People often comment that my newsletter is very personal, but it doesn’t feel that way to me. That’s because I follow the old advice: Write from the scar, not the wound.
- When I use my personal life in my writing, I’m very intentional about the purpose it’s playing. I don’t want the reader to walk away thinking about the gory and sordid details of my life, but rather, of their own. What you leave out is as important as what you include.
- You don’t write essays or books that resonate with loads of people by trying to write essays or books that resonate with loads of people. You do it by showing up to your writing practice often enough that you begin to close the gap between the great ideas in your head and how they come out on the page. You can’t hack it or shortcut it. You just have to show up.
