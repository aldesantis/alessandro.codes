## Summary

Data can be misleading and often hides flaws in research. Many people use numbers to support their claims without considering how the data was collected or analyzed. True insights come from understanding the complexities of culture, not just from relying on statistics.

## Highlights

- My fear is data is used in a way that does not necessarily represent cold hard objective truth and is being used as entertainment and sales. It’s being used for narrative construction.
- _As insights people, we are afraid of contradictions. If data point says A and data point says B, and those two things contradict one another, we’re going to throw one of those out to make sure we tell a consistent, standardized, believable story._
  _But we often forget that where there is contradiction, when things don’t add up, [that’s] where there’s true insight._
