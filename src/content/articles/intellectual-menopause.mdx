## Summary

“Intellectual menopause” refers to a decline in creative inspiration and vitality that often occurs in men around middle age. This phenomenon is characterized by a lack of imagination and a reluctance to embrace new ideas, leading to stagnation in thought and expression. The author reflects on his own experiences and observes that even younger individuals can exhibit signs of this intellectual decline.

- The world is in bad shape, but not _such_ bad shape that 21-year-olds have to foreclose on the possibility of a fertile youth before they even get going. The world can afford to let people have their 20s and 30s.
