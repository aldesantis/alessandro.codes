## Summary

Luxury fashion is facing a slowdown that presents an opportunity for brands to shift towards more sustainable practices. Experts suggest adopting circular business models, like rental and resale, to improve profitability and engage customers differently. As consumer behavior changes, brands must innovate to remain relevant and profitable without relying solely on new product sales.

## Highlights

- For sustainability experts, the takeaway is clear that [fashion’s success remains entirely dependent on selling new products](https://www.voguebusiness.com/sustainability/fashions-post-growth-future-covid-19). The business model has failed to pivot not only in [how brands drive growth](https://www.voguebusiness.com/sustainability/degrowth-the-future-that-fashion-has-been-looking-for) but also in how they [embed sustainability into their operations](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-56653-0_3).
- A 2019 [report](https://fashionforgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/The-Future-of-Circular-Fashion-Report-Fashion-for-Good.pdf) from Accenture Strategy and Fashion For Good analysed the economics of circular business models at a garment level, finding that luxury represents the clearest opportunity for successful adoption. Rental, subscription rental and re-commerce could all enable higher margins per garment than the existing industry baseline, according to the report — and, in addition to direct financial returns, the circular business models open up new opportunities.
- This year, there’s also been a [pushback against overconsumption](https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/sustainability/tiktoks-anti-overconsumption-movement-rule-of-5-wake-up-call-for-brands), manifesting most recently in the ‘[underconsumption core](https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/sustainability/want-to-be-more-sustainable-develop-a-better-sense-of-style)’ TikTok trend. Most analysts see no connection — people with whom the anti-overconsumption mentality is resonating are not the same demographic as the typical luxury consumer, whether routine or aspirational — but it does show that the tide might be turning against fashion’s business model from multiple directions.
