## Summary

One thing I want to say before we dive in here is THANK YOU. So many of you have responded to the welcome newsletter, and so many subsequent ones, with ideas, questions, problems, etc.

## Highlights
- Now, if we couldn’t find 3 or more quotes to add to a piece to support the arguments being made, well, then the argument we were making probably wasn’t all that realistic, relevant, or accurate.
- distribution. People love to see their name and their insights being used to back up claims in content that they didn’t have to put much effort into. So, social sharing and backlinking of our content immediately increased in volume––simply because we left that echo chamber.
