## Summary

2023 was a significant year for social commerce, with the launch of TikTok Shop in the U.S. and the growing convergence of social media and shopping. However, TikTok Shop is projected to lose $500 million in 2023, despite positive feedback from customers and merchants. Analysts predict that in 2024, more social commerce platforms will adopt a marketplace model, allowing independent sellers to list items without direct oversight. The challenge for social commerce lies in ensuring a positive customer experience and addressing concerns about counterfeit products. Nevertheless, the popularity of TikTok and the continued growth of social media make it a promising channel for brands to connect with customers.

- “The hardest component about a successful TikTok Shop strategy is being able to handle the virality of it all,” she said, noting that, In the first month on TikTok Shop, sales doubled every week, sometimes doubling every day. “We had to rebuild just about every part of our business to keep up with the extreme overnight demand without compromising our ship times. [But] it’s definitely a good problem to have.”
