## Summary

Happy Sunday! If you’re reading this, I hope you’re kicked back, on a couch, feet up, and have a beverage in your hand.

## Highlights

- The best CRO experts don’t just look to optimize a website. They look at the full funnel experience from who you are targeting, on which channel, with what creative and copy, that leads to which landing page, to sell what product, that is explained or presented in what way, to achieve the sale.
- Write copy for mobile, optimize the video or static ad for mobile, and optimize the LP experience for mobile (primarily focusing on the above-the-fold offer and CTA) The reason for this is that the majority of paid social traffic will be coming to you from mobile.
- Value props are features like a product being non-GMO or organic. Benefits are how this product changes your life, like telling you it will help you achieve clear skin or make you more confident to approach the man/woman you like, etc. Benefits sell more than value props and features do.
