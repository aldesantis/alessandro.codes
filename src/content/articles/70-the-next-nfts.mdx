## Summary

The text discusses the latest trends in the crypto world, focusing on NFTs, DeFi 2.0, and memecoins at Token2049 in Dubai. It highlights the shift towards a tokenized culture and the rise of memecoins as a new form of investment and community collaboration. The article emphasizes the growing importance of blockchain technology and the potential impact on consumer brands and society.

## Highlights
- *Memecoins should not be seen at their face value. They are a larger signal of a new type of organized groups collaborating in investment and profit sharing that is going to transform capital allocation, business and society at large.*
  *Brands should pay attention to the fact that group culture can be empowered by peer-to-peer technology, and not the speculative side of memecoins.*
