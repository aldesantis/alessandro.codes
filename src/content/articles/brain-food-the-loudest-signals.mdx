## Summary

“What I know for certain is that the conclusions I would draw from experience are different from the ones based only on figures.

## Highlights

- The loudest signals come from the emptiest sources. Those who truly possess something rarely need to announce it.
- “‘_I don’t have enough time’ is not a useful phrase when it comes to anything related to your dream. It’s okay to actively choose to do something or not, but don’t blame time._”
