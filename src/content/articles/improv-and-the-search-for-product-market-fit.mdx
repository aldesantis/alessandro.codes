## Summary

If you’d like to be put on a waitlist in case a seat opens up, or if you’d like to be first to be notified if/when the next edition of the course is run, please click here.

## Highlights

- Causal thinking is what you learn in business school. It starts with a fixed goal and works backwards to figure out how to get there — like deciding to cook carbonara for dinner, looking at your pantry, then working backwards to figuring out the ingredients needed, and shopping for those missing ingredients.
  Effectual thinking does the opposite: it starts with opening your fridge and asking, “What can I make with what I find here?” You work forwards from available resources, not backwards from a predetermined plan.
- Successful entrepreneurs don’t go all-in on a single idea. They set themselves up — financially, emotionally, and logistically — to take repeatable, reasonable risks. They aim to stay in the game long enough for something to work.
- If a market gap could be spotted through research alone, it’s probably not that valuable (and would likely be quickly exploited by an established competitor). Instead, experienced entrepreneurs take action and attempt to cut deals with relevant people — customers, partners, collaborators. Action generates real information.
