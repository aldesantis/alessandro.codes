## Summary

Cultural influence is the new consideration

## Highlights

- Brand marketing is the strategy of cultural influence. Brands used to influence mainstream culture through their advertising on mass media like TV, print, billboards, or public relations. Today, they influence culture through the cultural products they create: content, merchandising, events, aesthetics, experiences, archives, history, entertainment, fandom. These cultural products are directed to subcultures, taste communities, and consumer niches. Through these cultural products, brands tell their story.
- Once consumers buy into a brand story, they are less likely to leave or switch than when they just buy a product. Most critically, a good brand story guides which creative products are developed, and outlines their rollout and their media amplification strategy.
