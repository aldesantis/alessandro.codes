## Summary

Product design should avoid the “nightmare bicycle,” which uses confusing labels instead of intuitive systems. Good designs allow users to understand and apply a simple structure, while bad designs rely on superficial labels that confuse. People can learn and adapt, so products should trust their users’ abilities.

## Highlights

- Good designs expose systematic structure; they lean on their users’ ability to understand this structure and apply it to new situations. We were born for this.
  Bad designs paper over the structure with superficial labels that hide the underlying system, inhibiting their users’ ability to actually build a clear model in their heads.
