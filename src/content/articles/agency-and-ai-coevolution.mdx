## Summary

AI is becoming a cultural technology that changes how we think and evolve faster than genes.
Individual choices about what cognitive work to keep or delegate to AI scale up into cultural selection.
How we integrate AI now will shape collective skills, group organization, and our future agency.

## Highlights

- Here’s the key takeaway: if culture is now driving evolution faster than genes, then cultural technologies become part of the evolutionary process. And AI may be the most powerful cultural technology we’ve ever built.
- Culture—the accumulated wisdom of how to live well—allows us to be strategically inefficient. It teaches us which cognitive work to preserve because it serves our desire to “be human” and which to delegate because it doesn’t touch our core identity.
