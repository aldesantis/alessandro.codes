## Summary

Venture capital funding has led to inefficiencies in e-commerce by pushing businesses to prioritize rapid revenue growth over long-term profitability. This pressure can result in high fixed costs and customer acquisition challenges, leaving companies vulnerable if funding stops. While VC funding can support growth, it often creates conflicts between founders and investors, ultimately harming the business’s potential.

## Highlights

- In a D2C business, the _fixed cost-to-revenue_ ratio increases significantly as you scale, unlike in software. Costs such as inventory, warehousing, insurance, and utilities all rise as you work to acquire more customers, making it harder to maintain profitability at scale.
- There’s a limit to how many customers you can acquire “efficiently” or at profitability before your cost per acquisition (CPA) begins to rise. Acquiring new customers, especially through advertising, becomes increasingly challenging as you ramp up your spend and exceed your efficiency thresholds. A VC will urge you to push beyond these limits in pursuit of top-line growth, because for them, slow and steady does not win the race.
- When recording inventory expenses on your P&L, you can use one of two methods: accrual or cash-based accounting. Cash-based accounting is straightforward - any inventory you purchase is immediately recorded as an expense, reducing your earnings. Accrual accounting, on the other hand, only records inventory as a cost once it’s sold.
- Investors will often negate the need for patience and look to push your revenue aggressively in the first year, and potentially sell secondary shares to the next sucker that thinks your brand has potential with a revenue based model.
