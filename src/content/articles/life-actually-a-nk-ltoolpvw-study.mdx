## Summary

A recent study surveyed over 1,000 Gen Z individuals to understand their hopes and dreams, revealing three distinct groups: Neo-Traditionalists, Fluid Pragmatists, and Internet-Age Explorers. The findings show that Gen Z’s aspirations and concerns are similar to those of previous generations, emphasizing the need for brands to connect on a deeper level. Overall, it highlights the complexity of youth culture and the importance of looking beyond superficial trends.

## Highlights

- **Data dissonance**—the disconnect between data used to tell stories about culture, and culture itself—is especially pronounced when it comes to Gen Z.
- We found that most traits, characteristics and desires are as unique to Gen Z as to any prior generation—further emphasizing the need to think critically about what we read and uncover about Gen Z, and to look to psychographics for valuable insights.
