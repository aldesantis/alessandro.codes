## Summary

My first company was a classic service business. Some people like to call these agencies.

## Highlights

- Whatever you get paid on day one is what you should assume is the only money you are ever going to get.
- Think of bankers and brokers like real estate agents. Their main incentive is to get a deal done, not to get you the best deal.
  This is an important distinction. An extra $5M or $10M matters a lot to you. To the banker? They would rather get the deal for less money than no deal for more money.
  Their incentive is the transaction. Your incentive is the scope of the transaction. This can create a massive amount of conflict between you and your banker.
