## Summary

Work doesn’t have to be a struggle; it can be enjoyable and fulfilling. Many people are conditioned to believe that hard work must involve suffering, but this mindset can harm those who aren’t wired for constant grinding. Embracing a more joyful approach to work can lead to greater satisfaction and creativity.

## Highlights

- You can like your work. Projects can feel light while still being challenging. You can spend many hours on things because you care about them and not because of some extrinsic goal. And you can do things without overcoming anything or feeling the need to denigrate others who are not grinding hard enough.
- Everything you want is on the other side of uncomfortable emotions you don’t want to feel.
