## Summary

Marketers often overcomplicate advertising by focusing too much on personalization instead of understanding the market’s fundamentals. The most effective ads are those that appeal broadly to all audiences, rather than being overly segmented. Businesses should prioritize consistent brand advertising to build lasting associations, rather than relying solely on discounts and promotions.

## Highlights

- Segmentation is based on the idea that you should break up your total market into groups to better tailor your ads to what each group wants. However, it is only useful if there are noticeable and distinct differences within a market that can be capitalised on.
- If a business has to rely on deals and promos rather than memory and positive associations then it is not a strong brand, as there is no preference beyond price.
- The overwhelming reality was and is that the best ad for one audience is the best ad for all audiences.
- Facebook is incentivised to show adverts to the people who will engage with it most – or at least be least annoyed by it – so it targets people at the end of the buying cycle, who are in the market for your product. This often means people who have already been on your website and are likely to buy even without seeing an ad; one of the many attribution issues plaguing digital marketing.
- If the goal of brand advertising is to increase the likelihood of purchase through ‘cultural imprinting’, as described by Kevin Simler in “Ads don’t work that way”, then ‘personalised’ targeting is the exact opposite of what you should be doing.
  The mechanism only works if the ad is highly conspicuous – you have to believe that everyone else saw it too – for buying the product to be a meaningful communicator of status or preferences.
- The primary thing a Superbowl ad tells you about a company is that they’re doing well enough to afford a Superbowl ad, and buying their product is probably a safe bet.
- If you’re a small startup with less than 1% of your market, capture as much cheap existing demand as possible – in the long term you might be dead otherwise.
- The oft quoted “If you increase your loyalty by just 5% then you will double profits” is not quite what it seems. The example quoted used a loyalty percentage rate that went from 5% to 10%.
- As a business grows and expands, then it has no choice but to expand its targeting to the broader market. And those businesses that are big must continue to do the same, in the knowledge that most of their customers are light buyers and no amount of clever consultancy bingo is going to change those outcomes.
- The temptation of the last ten years has been to see advertising and marketing as a feat of engineering, due to the explosion of new technology and to outsize its importance in the marketing toolset. Advertising is not persuasive, yet it’s a myth that holds. Advertising is a weak force, but it’s a universal cost of doing business – it’s a tax you have to pay to grow.
