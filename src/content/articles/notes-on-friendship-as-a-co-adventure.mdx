## Summary

The document reflects on the author’s experiences with friendship as a shared adventure, particularly during a gathering in Spain called RichFest. It contrasts the feeling of living life alongside others in unique experiences versus the more common narrative exchange among friends. The need for deeper, more engaging friendships that involve shared experiences rather than just updates is highlighted. The author also discusses strategies for fostering more meaningful connections, both in physical interactions and online communities, emphasizing the importance of intentional engagement and environment design in combating feelings of isolation and loneliness.

## Highlights

- While it’s a genuine blessing to have friendships where we sincerely want to know how each other’s lives are unfolding, I realised that I also want more friends who I do life with rather than just talk about my life with. It seems that talking about my life takes me out of it somehow, putting me into a kind of reflective, evaluative mode that often makes my life feel less good than when I’m just living it.
