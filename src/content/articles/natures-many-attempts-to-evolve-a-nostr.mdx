## Summary

The article discusses the evolution of internet architectures, highlighting how centralized systems control user data and create oligopolies. It introduces the Nostr protocol as a new approach that uses relays, allowing users to own their data and cryptographic keys while avoiding the pitfalls of both centralized and federated systems. This model offers a simpler and more effective solution for decentralized communication.

## Highlights

- The architecture of apps is [fundamentally feudal](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/web3). Apps own the keys and use them to erect a [cryptographic wall](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) around the hoard of data us peasants produce. You “sign in” to cross the drawbridge, and the castle can pull up the drawbridge at any time, shutting you out.
- Federated networks become oligopolies at scale

  **Why does this happen?** Well, networks centralize over time, converging toward an exponential distribution of size, power, wealth. **[This centralization is inevitable](https://newsletter.squishy.computer/p/centralization-is-inevitable)**.
- Large feds occupy a strategically central location in the network topology, and they have powerful influence over the rest of the network. They can leverage their network effect to pull up the drawbridge, by inventing new features that don’t federate, or cutting off contact with other feds.
