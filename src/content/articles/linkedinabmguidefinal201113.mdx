## Summary

The document provides a comprehensive guide for achieving success in Account-Based Marketing (ABM) on LinkedIn. It outlines essential steps such as achieving executive alignment, defining objectives, selecting target accounts, identifying the buying committee, determining the right scale, aligning content to the audience, and measuring impact. It emphasizes the importance of collaboration between marketing and sales teams, the significance of data quality in ABM strategy, and the role of LinkedIn in enhancing audience targeting and engagement. The guide offers practical tips, case studies, and statistics to help marketers understand and implement effective ABM strategies using LinkedIn’s platform.

## Highlights

- It’s been proven, time and again, that when marketing and sales collaborate to identify a set of high-value accounts and work in tandem to deliver relevant buying experiences, it produces more efficient performance and stronger results.
- Increase pipeline velocity and win rates by engaging a wider audience of stakeholders during the sales process
- Grow usage of your solutions across the account by tapping into new lines of business or folding new products into the existing portfolio
- Share how-to guides, best practices, industry trends, research reports
- Take your most successful customers and look for companies with similar firmographic, technographic and economic profiles on LinkedIn.
  This allows you to identify new companies that are most likely to match your ICP.
- With your ICP guiding the way, you will be able to identify a list of high-value, high-potential accounts. As a next step, we recommend segmenting your accounts.
  Doing so gives you much greater control over how to steer your investments and efforts. It also allows you to prioritise the accounts that are expected to contribute the most revenue or value to your organisation.
- It’s best to define the account list tiers together with your sales team while considering: ☐ Relationship and connection density
  ☐ Intent models based on deal stage and engagement
  ☐ Deal size and potential revenue ☐ Client references within the space
- Use Matched Audiences to upload your target company or contact email lists ☐ Use Audience Breakdown to find commonalities such as industry and company size
- Aim for a list size of at least 10,000 email addresses • If an individual has more than one email address, include them all • Provide the contact’s first and last name as well as company name for more accurate matching
  - Aim for a list size of at least 1,000 organisations • Provide their LinkedIn Page URLs for more accurate matching
- Senior individual contributors are an oftenoverlooked audience. While they may not have any direct reports, they can have a large say in buying decisions due to their advanced domain knowledge.

- One of the most important things that you need to know about ABM is that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. The spectrum of ABM ranges from one-on-one conversations with your largest accounts, to programmatic ABM targeting hundreds of lower-value accounts. When deciding which scale is right for you, also remember that you can deploy different approaches for different account tiers.
