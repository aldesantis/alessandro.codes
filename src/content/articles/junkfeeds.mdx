## Summary

Rewilding our Digital Attention

## Highlights

- Algorithmic feeds the worst, not because they are bad feeds (quality is better!) but because they remove your agency.

## Summary

We could call this strange geography created by technology “AirSpace.

## Highlights

- Every physical space is now secondary - there is no physical space left that is the primary place we are. We are always primarily in digital space and secondarily in physical space.
- “Junkspace is often described as a space of flows, but that is a misnomer; flows depend on disciplined movement, bodies that cohere. Junkspace is a web without spider; although it is an architecture of the masses, each trajectory is strictly unique.”
- We check our feeds when we’re anxious. And junkfeeds make us anxious, radicalized, paranoid, scared, angry.
- The algorithm does not recommend - it reflects. It’s a machine for turning our own biases against us. Literally programmed it is a recipe for turning depravation into clicks.
- From the standpoint of capitalist valorisation, this flow is uninterrupted and finds its unity in the object produced; however, from the standpoint of cognitive workers the supply of labor is fragmented: fractals of time and pulsating cells of labor are switched on and off in the large control room of global production. Therefore the supply of labor time can be disconnected from the physical and juridical person of the worker. Social labor time becomes an ocean of valorising cells that can be summoned and recombined in accordance with the needs of capital.
- Search function is the unregulated feed of our basest emotions sidestepping any notion of people you know and mmoving straight to third base with sex, abs, comedy, guns, politics, travel. It’s a funhouse mirror of our own desires reflected back to us in an infinite feed.
