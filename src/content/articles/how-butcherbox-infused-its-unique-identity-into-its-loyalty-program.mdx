## Summary

Any company can offer 2% cash back. ButcherBox’s Sizzle Society stands out with the three tiers and an emphasis on experiential benefits.

## Highlights

- “I think customers would tell you 10 times out of 10 they want transparency and want all the information, but they don’t want to be inundated with it,” ButcherBox said.
- Experiential benefits, like priority support and Q&As with the CEO, help ensure Sizzle Society stays profitable.
