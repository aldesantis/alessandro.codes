## Summary

In 2024, sustainable fashion faced challenges despite some progress, as scandals and slow policy changes hindered its growth. Consumer behavior became polarized, with some embracing sustainable practices while others fell into fast fashion trends. As the industry looks to 2025, there is a call for focused action and proven solutions to achieve sustainability goals.

On the other, ‘de-influencing’ and ‘[underconsumption core](https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/sustainability/tiktoks-anti-overconsumption-movement-rule-of-5-wake-up-call-for-brands)’ hit the mainstream, with people celebrating decluttering, using products up fully and only buying what they really need. In the midst of this, researchers recognised the climate crisis as a behaviour crisis, and [shopping addiction as an evolutionary impulse](https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/sustainability/how-to-combat-our-evolutionary-addiction-to-shopping).
