## Summary

A growing number of B2B marketers are adopting account-based marketing (ABM) to drive long-term revenue growth by focusing marketing resources on engaging specific target accounts. ABM requires alignment between sales and marketing teams to personalize messaging and programs for key prospects within target accounts, leading to higher revenues in a shorter timeframe. Successful ABM implementation benefits sales, marketing, and customers by enhancing collaboration, personalizing outreach, and delivering higher ROI compared to other marketing campaigns. Developing a successful ABM strategy involves identifying high-value accounts, mapping individuals to accounts, creating targeted campaigns, pinpointing optimal channels, executing campaigns, and measuring results to optimize tactics.

## Highlights
- In its simplest form, ABM is a strategy that directs marketing resources to engage a specific set of target accounts.
- While the top objective is to land new accounts or expand business with existing ones, marketing and sales should define smaller goals that align to the bigger goals. These stepwise goals can include:
  • Pinpointing a higher number of decision-makers within each account
  • Securing a greater number of senior-level appointments/meetings
  • Accelerating the sales cycle
  • Encouraging higher customer loyalty or reducing churn
  • Closing a higher percentage of large deals
  • Boosting revenues within existing accounts
