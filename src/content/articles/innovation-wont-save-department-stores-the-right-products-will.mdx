## Summary

Department stores like Macy’s and Kohl’s are struggling to attract customers and are closing many locations due to competition from online retailers and discount chains. To survive, they need to offer unique products that customers can’t easily find elsewhere. Experts believe that by refreshing their merchandise and creating a more appealing shopping experience, department stores can still succeed.

They must rethink the entire value proposition that they present to their target customer, starting with what they stock on their shelves and their websites.
