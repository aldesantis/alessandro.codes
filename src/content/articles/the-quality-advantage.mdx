## Summary

Chinese luxury brands are gaining success by focusing on high-quality materials and craftsmanship rather than just advertising. Consumers, especially younger ones, now value durable, well-made products over fast trends or flashy marketing. Brands that prioritize quality can build lasting customer loyalty and succeed in a competitive global market.

## Highlights

- The most important piece of brand communication today is not a fashion campaign, an invite-only dinner or an event, store windows, or a beautiful Instagram grid. Itâ€™s the quality of fabrics, materials, cut, or hardware.
- Any brand that is looking to claim - or reclaim - relevance should start with quality first: of its fabrics, materials, hardware, finishes and fit. Good marketing brings the customer in, but quality keeps them coming back and advocating for the brand.
