## Summary

Brands are evolving in the Web3 space to prioritize community ownership and involvement over traditional control. This shift allows members to create value and shape the brand, fostering authenticity and adaptability. Ultimately, brands that embrace decentralization and collaboration will thrive, while those that resist may fall behind.

## Highlights

- _The concept of being permissionless is_ the _most powerful bootstrapping tool for a brand. It’s the potential to redefine the anatomy of a brand itself, the ability for members to create value however and whenever they feel without permission, combining the attention and ownership economy to distribute a brand between an entire community that owns it._
- “A brand has no objective existence at all: it is simply a collection of perceptions held in the mind of the consumer.”
- By structuring a relationship between influencers and brands based on fees, brands adopted an approach of buying their way into communities. Ultimately turning the influencer into a contractor and establishing a dichotomy where the brand and influencer exist in separate realms with conflicting interests.
- Rather, what’s unique is the ability to construct _collective value_ and _mutual interests_ through a digital NFT that positions The Hundreds and its community of ABS holders in the same boat. It’s a way of going public for a privately owned brand, along with the Discord and social mediums that facilitate participation, and begin to _dissolve the split between brand and community, where the two are one._
- Ultimately, _it means letting go of the idea that you, and solely you, possess permission to tell others what your brand is._ It means _s_eeing misunderstanding, criticism and feedback not as an attack or assault on a brand you’ve worked so hard to create, but rather as a gift that someone cares enough about your impact on the world to try to help improve it.
  **It means seeing the dissolution between brand and community, where brand _is_ community, and community _is_ brand.**
