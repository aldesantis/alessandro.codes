## Summary

To balance brand marketing and performance marketing, it’s essential to prioritize brand supremacy. Brand marketing focuses on perception and long-term growth, while performance marketing aims for immediate results. Successful marketing integrates both approaches, where brand creates opportunities and performance captures them.

## Highlights

- Brand marketing is entirely about who you are in the context of who your audience is and how you want to then be perceived. It is fundamentally associative. If it’s not associative, it’s probably not genuine brand marketing.
- Branding is about putting yourself in a position to grow; it is not growth per se. If brand marketing were farming, it wouldn’t even be planting the seeds; it would be sowing the soil so that you could eventually plant the seeds.
- What makes performance hard in terms of it being the method to establish a brand is that the assets usually associated with it (PPC, SEO, etc.) are secondary branding assets in the context of how users discover them.
