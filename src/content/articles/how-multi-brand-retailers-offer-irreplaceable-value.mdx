## Summary

Multi-brand retailers (MBRs) provide unique value by offering consumers a variety of brands and convenient shopping options. They help brands reach a wider audience and handle customer service, which allows for better sales opportunities. By collaborating closely, brands and MBRs can gain valuable insights into customer preferences and improve their overall effectiveness.

## Highlights

- Brands don’t need to handle the service burden when MBRs do this for them. MBRs can also offer omnichannel shopping, and offer all the convenience of online, mail-order, Buy Online Pickup In Store (BOPIS) or in-store shopping.
- Brands who offer D2C miss out on the power of multi-purchase or ‘complementary’ shopping, and the value provided by expert merchandising. This enables additional sales to be captured by grouping dissimilar items and different brands that are frequently purchased together, because of the customer intention.
- While a brand can leverage ultra-specific advertising that targets their best customers, they miss out on selling to their other customers. MBRs can execute broader marketing campaigns that capitalize on bigger trends – Brands cannot do this alone.
- The super-fans might love a particular brand, but _most_ consumers do not care. Is it Adidas, Puma, or Nike? For them it doesn’t matter. They’ll look around the store at several shoes (and many other products) and choose whichever is most attractive or on promotion at the time.
