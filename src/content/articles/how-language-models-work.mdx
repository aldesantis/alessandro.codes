## Summary

Language models work by predicting the next word based on context, creating complex “Super Words” that include detailed information about meaning. They build a vast dictionary from their training on the internet and represent these Super Words on a map, allowing them to understand and generate language. This process shows how language is interconnected and how we can use these models creatively and effectively.

## Highlights

- Language models pay attention to any word in the prompt that might be relevant to the last word, and then use _that_ to update their understanding of what that last word is. Then they predict what comes next.
