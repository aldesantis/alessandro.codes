## Summary

The article discusses the implications of longer replacement cycles for commerce platforms on the commerce tech market. Previously, the average replacement cycle for an enterprise commerce platform was four to five years, but now it has doubled to every eight to twelve years. This is due to factors such as the larger size and higher risk associated with e-commerce businesses, intangible business benefits of replatforming, high switching costs of customized legacy platforms, resistance to change in business processes, and conservative tech investment plans. As a result, the commerce tech market has shifted towards specialist point-solutions that complement and coexist with commerce platforms. The long-term trend is expected to favor platforms and point-solutions that offer composability and API-first capabilities to support digital commerce and marketing evolution.

## Highlights

- While the 8.3 average jumps out here, if you drill into the businesses making changes for fundamental business strategy and a need to respond to “market disruption”, the replacement cycle extends to twelve years. For vendors, that means that today only 8% percent of the market is “in-play” in any given year, and a large number of them may still decide to do nothing.
- When CommerceNext surveyed American e-commerce business leaders a little over a year ago only [14% of e-commerce leaders](https://commercenext.com/2022-digital-trends-investment-priorities/) felt a new commerce platform had potential to drive growth
- So the path forward from here is for commerce platforms to in a sense decompose and offer specific services in a similar way the specialist software solutions do - cohabitating with and complimenting them - while delivering simplicity and synergies for clients who want a relatively quick way of getting started with them when and if they do replatform.
- We are now in an era where many are advocating for platforms in part due to the impetus for vendor consolidation and cost reduction on the part of buyers. In my opinion, this is a relatively short-term condition, and the long-term will favor the platforms and point-solutions that offer composability and an API-first, plug-n-play capability to enhance and support customers’ digital commerce and marketing evolution longer-term.
