## Summary

The economy is splitting: wealthy shoppers spend more, value shoppers hold steady, and the middle is shrinking. Luxury brands are focusing on high-end customers and also creating affordable, experiential entry points. This split forces brands to choose strategies that protect prestige while courting future buyers.

## Highlights

- “Retailers who are really focused on value are doing very well, and retailers that are really focused on a higher-income consumer are doing well,” said Elizabeth LaFontaine, director of research at the location intelligence platform Placer.ai. “That leaves a lot of the traditional apparel retailers in the middle really fighting amongst themselves for the consumer’s attention.”
