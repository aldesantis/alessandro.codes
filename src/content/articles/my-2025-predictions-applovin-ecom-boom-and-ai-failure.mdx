## Summary

Disclosure: Because of the beliefs shared below I’ve decided to invest in AppLovin before writing this article. This isn’t financial or business advice.

## Highlights

- AppLovin will eat all of DTC’s advertising budget that doesn’t go to Meta.
  - The desire to be less dependent on Meta is REAL.
  - TikTok is banned.
  - Reddit is popular but has the same targeting difficulties as YouTube.
  - Google is extracting cash while battling ChatGPT.
  - No one has nailed prospecting on Direct Mail.
  - TV requires too much creative work to launch.
  The ecosystem is ripe for a new channel, and AppLovin is giving me Meta 2016 vibes:
  - Bad ad buying platform with limited inventory
  - Most serious advertisers don’t take it seriously
  - Immense scale + crazy active user base.
- Fed interest rates are Banks/Financial institutions “COGS” equivalent. The lower their COGS are, the lower their standards will become to loan out money.
