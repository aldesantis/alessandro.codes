## Summary

Costco's success is driven by its unique business model, offering high-quality products at low prices by keeping markups low and charging a fixed membership fee. With limited product offerings and a focus on its own brand, Costco maximizes efficiency, turnover, and bargaining power with suppliers. Additionally, Costco's exceptional treatment of employees, including higher wages and long-term career prospects, contributes to its low turnover rate and loyal workforce. These factors have led to Costco's enduring popularity among customers, employees, and investors alike, cementing its position as a leading retailer in the industry.

## Highlights
- Costco is the world’s third-biggest retailer, behind Walmart and Amazon. Though its sales are less than half of Walmart’s, its return on capital, at nearly 20%, is more than twice as high.
