## Summary

Kyle Denhoff from HubSpot highlights the benefits of industry newsletters as a key growth channel. He emphasizes that quality leads from newsletters convert better, and building trust through valuable content is essential. With declining trust in mass media, professionals are increasingly turning to niche newsletters for insights.

## Highlights
- Sources like Organic Search, Social, Swaps, Meta and Sparkloop consistently outperform low-cost options like co-reg. Yes, the cost per subscriber is higher, but the engagement and retention make it worth it.
- While most prospect emails push promotions or meetings, editorial newsletters flip the script. We lead with value - industry insights, expert commentary, practical education. Build trust first, monetize later.
