## Summary

The original promise of personal computing was a new kind of clay. Instead, we got appliances: built far away, sealed, unchangeable. In this essay, we envision malleable software: tools that users can reshape with minimal friction to suit their unique needs.

## Highlights

- Each of these techniques gives a different tradeoff between power and skill. If someone just wants to tweak a color on a website, they should be able to do it in a less expressive system focused on that task, rather than needing to build an entire browser extension.
- **Many applications are avocado slicers.** They’re a bundle of functionality targeted at some specific use case: planning a trip, tracking workouts, organizing recipes. Because an app needs to handle many tasks associated with a use case, it sometimes doesn’t handle any of them particularly well.
- **When each application manages its own data, introducing a new tool into a workflow incurs more friction**. It’s easier to stay within an existing application to complete the whole job, even if superior alternatives exist for completing some part of the task.
- **Building software for “local” contexts is sometimes _easier_ than building software for world-wide use.** You don’t need to build airtight, industrial-grade software if you are in direct contact with your users and can be responsive to the situations they run into.
