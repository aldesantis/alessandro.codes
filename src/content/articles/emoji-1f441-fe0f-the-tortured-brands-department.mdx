## Summary

P. S.

## Highlights

- For a brand to stand out during a large cultural moment, they must participate in the discourse. The most adept will find ways to create coded-language content. The Pizza Hut tweet is a wonderful example of this.
  This monocultural celebration—something [we’ve referred to as ‘hyperculture’](https://futurecommerce.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=c08f64351704a1ea4479bd08b&id=2474e97a69&e=2d0299bab1)—is a participatory act. Cultural philosopher Henry Jenkins theorized this would take place when the barrier to entry for participation tips over from consumer to producer; meaning, more people are participating than those who are consuming. In a prior era, consumers expected 2-Day fast, free, shipping. Today they expect cultural commentary and multiplayer participation.
