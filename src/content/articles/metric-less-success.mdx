## Summary

The author reflects on the difference between traditional success, which is often measured by wealth, and metric-less success, which focuses on meaningful relationships and personal values. While society values quantifiable achievements, true fulfillment comes from love, compassion, and living authentically. Ultimately, what matters most is not what you earn, but how you impact the lives of others and stay true to yourself.

## Highlights
- Traditional success will get you on magazine covers, but metric-less success will get you on family albums. While society as a whole worships quantifiable success, what will ultimately matter most to the individual is everything that can’t be counted.
- Our desires are often directed outward because that’s where we’re most aware of what we lack. But all those desires will be leveled to zero if what you lack is access to your physical faculties. So by retaining a strong baseline of health, you are placing yourself in a position where any pursuit is achievable.
