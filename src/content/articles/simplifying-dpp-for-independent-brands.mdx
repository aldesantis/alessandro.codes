## Summary

The article discusses how independent brands can simplify their approach to transparency under DPP regulations. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on product, material, and asset data before tackling the more complex event data tracking. By doing so, brands can enhance consumer engagement and leverage transparency as a competitive advantage.

## Highlights

- Instead, sustainability efforts should focus on nailing the product, material and asset level data. Leveraging transparency as a competitive advantage by making consumers feel good and informed about their purchases.
- Setting aside the bigger ethical imperative of sustainability, there is a clear opportunity for brands to leverage transparency as a competitive advantage pre-purchase. And the threat of DPP legislation may just be the kick up the a**e brands need to start doing the right thing.

- A lot of noise surrounding event level tracking within DPP blends into broader discussions around the concept of _circularity._ The notion of event level tracking through a products entire lifespan simply aren’t in the realms of possibility (yet) and feels unlikely to ever happen. To expect consumers to add data, or even a resale or recycling partner with the millions of garments they receive, just doesn’t seem fathomable.
