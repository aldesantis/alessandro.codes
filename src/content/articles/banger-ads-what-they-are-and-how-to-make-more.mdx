## Summary

I want to define a “banger ad” and show you some examples, because I think the question clears up a lot of confusion when it comes to the eternal question “are my Meta ads working?

## Highlights

- This observation aligns with my experience, but for fashion brands, there is one important caveat: product determines “banger” status as much as, or more than, creative execution. So, for fashion brands, the quest to find banger ads is _also_ a quest to produce best-selling products.
- The Meta user loves sparkly, shiny, bright, colorful things that look more expensive than they are. I covered that in more detail [here](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vu2me52mzi9h9o5gwzclhvl7g555fn/x0hph6hwglme5va5/aHR0cHM6Ly9kdGNmYXNoaW9uZGVjb2RlZC5jb20vcG9zdHMvNS1waWxsYXJzLW9mLWEtbWV0YS1hZHMtcHJvZHVjdC1hc3NvcnRtZW50) and [here](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vu2me52mzi9h9o5gwzclhvl7g555fn/25h2hoh25ex3kxs3/aHR0cHM6Ly9kdGNmYXNoaW9uZGVjb2RlZC5jb20vcG9zdHMvd2hhdC1tb3N0LWJyYW5kcy1nZXQtd3JvbmctYWJvdXQtbWV0YS1hZHM=).

  If you can make this your brand aesthetic, you are much more likely to win consistently. Even if this isn’t your aesthetic, you need to study which products tend to drive more profitable spend on Meta and make more products with similar characteristics.
