## Summary

But only members who previously purchased one of Nike’s virtual releases will have the chance to buy it.

## Highlights
- Still, exclusivity is currency in the sneaker world, and the release demonstrates how Nike is thinking about using its NFT-based platform to engage what it views as an increasingly important fan group while letting it promote membership, which remains one of the most powerful tools in its kit.
- We see a [virtual] shoe that one day unlocks access to a pre-order of a physical shoe, or one day unlocks access to a token-gated chat with our designers where you can help shape certain decisions around what colourway we launch with, or another day where you could unlock the wearable version in your favourite game or in your favourite immersive experience,” Faris [told BoF](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/technology/nike-is-launching-its-first-big-web3-project/) around .Swoosh’s launch last year.
