## Summary

AI can either replace experts by automating their core tasks or make their work more valuable by handling routine jobs. Professionals who succeed with AI use their judgment to guide it and evolve their roles to focus on complex, human-centered skills. The key is to work intentionally with AI, blending human expertise with machine power to create new forms of valued expertise.

## Highlights

- The more you understand the domain, the better you can direct AI’s capabilities and catch its limitations.
- Experienced professionals have something novices lack—deep pattern recognition that lets them spot when AI suggestions don’t fit the broader context.
- The most successful experienced professionals don’t cling to doing everything they used to do. Instead, they leverage their years of experience to move up the value chain.
