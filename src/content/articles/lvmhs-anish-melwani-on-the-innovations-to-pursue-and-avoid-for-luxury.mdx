## Summary

LVMH's Anish Melwani emphasizes the importance of understanding younger consumers' preferences in the luxury market. He sees potential in storytelling through digital platforms and entertainment while being cautious about resale and rental models. Melwani is optimistic about digital product passports and artificial intelligence, viewing them as key technologies for the future of luxury.

## Highlights
- “[Younger consumers] are almost discovering websites, and I think it’s, in part, for authenticity,” he said. “If you go to a website, you know you are being marketed to, but there is no algorithm feeding you what you want to see… It’s the official story from the brand.”
- “We have to keep creating new things to stay culturally relevant. If we make a big chunk of our business reselling stuff that was culturally relevant in the past, I haven’t squared that with keeping up with modernity,” he said.
- “The goal of luxury is to minimise how much you put through the off-price channel… We don’t overproduce that much, and so we would rather recycle that than sell at a discount. The goal is to be able to sell things at full price… If you have inventory to put through an off-price channel, it’s because something went wrong.”
