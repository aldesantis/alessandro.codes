## Summary

A growing number of brands, particularly in beauty, are including loyal customers in the product development process and offering ways for fans to directly benefit from their growth.

## Highlights

- The companies that are able to effectively do so increase their chances of financial success and longevity, experts say. The direct feedback that communities provide saves them time and money developing products that wonâ€™t sell. They can also lower their advertising costs as fans organically spread the word about their products to their own micro-communities.
