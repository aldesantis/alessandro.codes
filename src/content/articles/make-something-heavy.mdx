## Summary

Creating often lacks substance, leading to a sense of hollowness. We need to focus on making “heavy” things that have lasting value and meaning. Balancing light and heavy creations is essential for true fulfillment as a creator.

## Highlights

- **The modern makers’ machine does not want you to create heavy things.** It runs on the internet—powered by social media, fueled by mass appeal, and addicted to speed. It thrives on spikes, scrolls, and screenshots. It resists weight and avoids friction. It does not care for patience, deliberation, or anything but _production_.
- AI now promises results without the reckoning, but frictionless creation leads to weightless rewards.
- Creation isn’t just about output. It’s a process of becoming. The best work shapes the maker as much as the audience. A founder builds a startup to prove they can. A writer wrestles an idea into clarity. You don’t just create heavy things. You become someone who can.
- Lightness has its virtues — it helps keep you fresh, get in the reps, and work up to the heavy thing.
- Why does it feel bad to stop posting after weeks of consistency? Because the force of your work instantly drops to zero. _It was all motion, no mass—momentum without weight. 99% dopamine, near-zero serotonin, and no trace of oxytocin._
- Note: heavy doesn’t always mean “big.” Heavy can be small or niche or hard to scale. What I’m talking about is more like density. It’s better understood as what’s defining, meaningful, durable.
