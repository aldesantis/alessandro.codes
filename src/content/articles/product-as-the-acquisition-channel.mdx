## Summary

Products can act as their own marketing by being instantly recognizable and creating desire. Hero products attract customers, while limited editions and collaborations create urgency and visits. Successful brands make products so appealing that people want to see, share, and return to buy more.

## Highlights

- Product discoverability is a design feature, which turns a product into the acquisition channel. When a product is carried or worn by people, when it shows up in feeds,
  when it pops up in resale or is mentioned in conversation, it creates intent that converts into a store visit or a click.
- Merch and other cultural products (content, customization, events) amplify the brand’s core products, make them shareable, and generate organic referral loops: more sightings produce more searches, more searches become visits, more visits turn products into a social objects and the store the place where people go to gather.
