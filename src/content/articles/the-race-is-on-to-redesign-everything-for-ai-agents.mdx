## Summary

The rise of AI agents is changing how we design products, as they are now actively selecting vendors and making decisions. To succeed, businesses must focus on creating experiences for both humans and AI, ensuring their offerings are easily understood by these agents. The future will favor those who adapt their strategies to align with how AI evaluates and interacts with products.

## Highlights
- Traditional advertising is designed to appeal to human psychology. In a world rich with agents, your product needs to be positioned for AI comprehension. It's no longer just about brand awareness or emotional appealsâ€”it's about ensuring your digital product is structured in ways that make AI systems confident in recommending it.
