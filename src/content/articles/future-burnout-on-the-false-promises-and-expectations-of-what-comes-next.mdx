## Summary

The text discusses how modern society struggles with the tension between the past and the future, leading to a new form of burnout focused on time. It highlights how technology, while promising to enhance our experiences, often intensifies our anxiety about time slipping away. Ultimately, it calls for a shift to living in the present moment as a way to reclaim our sense of time.

## Highlights

- In our quest to bridge the chasm between past and future, technology has become both the accelerant of our condition, and the supposed remedy for such temporal anxieties.
- It’s strange to imagine a time before the tyranny of the 6:00 AM email check, when sleep wasn’t a single, brutal block of unconsciousness squeezed between frantic activity and the predictable blaring of an alarm.
- It seems as though technology has suggested to us that we are the colonizers of time, and that we can conquer and subdue its natural flow, bending it to our will with augmented reality goggles and endless streams of notifications, which have become the furniture of modern life.
