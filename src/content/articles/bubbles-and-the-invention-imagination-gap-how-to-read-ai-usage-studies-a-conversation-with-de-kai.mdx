## Summary

We’ve entered the Bubble Prediction phase of AI. Some see valuations floating safely forward; others warn of collapse.

## Highlights

- The hardest part of bubbles isn’t imagining the crash, but the invention. Just as Amazon solved fulfillment logistics in ways that weren’t obvious when it was ‘just a bookstore,’ AI companies today might solve cost and energy challenges through approaches we can’t yet see—perhaps through dramatic efficiency gains, edge computing, or hybrid cloud-device architectures.
- Every bubble exaggerates the present and underestimates the future.
