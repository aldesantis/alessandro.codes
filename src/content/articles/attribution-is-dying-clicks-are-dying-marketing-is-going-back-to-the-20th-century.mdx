## Summary

Marketing is changing, and traditional methods of tracking clicks and attributing sales are becoming less effective. Social media platforms are favoring native content, leading to fewer clicks, while privacy laws and ad blockers make attribution difficult. To succeed in 2024, marketers need to focus on influencing audiences through various channels instead of relying solely on data-driven attribution models.

## Highlights

- And I’m urging you to invest in it and to optimize for it using [lift-based measurement and not attribution](https://sparktoro.com/blog/how-to-measure-hard-to-measure-marketing-channels/).
  Because attribution fundamentally don’t work anymore. When you make marketing investments based, instead, on knowing who your audience is and where/how you can influence them, you can massively improve your results.
