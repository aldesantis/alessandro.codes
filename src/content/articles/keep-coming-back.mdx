## Summary

The author shares insights on building community by emphasizing the importance of regular, low-cost gatherings. These spaces, like local clubs or groups, allow people to connect with acquaintances and neighbors without needing deep friendships right away. By consistently showing up, individuals can form meaningful connections and help combat loneliness in our busy lives.

## Highlights

- I’ve noticed that the best spaces to get more people into your life tend to have a few things in common:
  - They are free or low cost, which helps removes a classist or elitist element.
  - They are repeating, recurring activities that don’t require a ton of scheduling in advance.
  - They are centered around a shared interest or need, which could be as specific as a hobby, as broad as a place or park, or as simple as the need to eat dinner.
  - They are relatively local to where you live.
