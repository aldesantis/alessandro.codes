## Summary

OpenAI’s ChatGPT is growing slowly and may add ads to make money. Many users worry that ads will ruin the clean, neutral experience they like. If ads appear, some users might switch to other AI tools like Google’s Gemini.

## Highlights

- People already associate Google’s products with advertising so commercial messages there feel almost built into the premise. ChatGPT, by contrast, built its identity on being something else. Changing that expectation is a heavier lift than it looks, especially against Gemini’s growth in recent months.
