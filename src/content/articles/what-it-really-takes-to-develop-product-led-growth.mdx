## Summary

Many B2B software companies are considering this approach without a clear understanding of the capabilities required.

## Highlights

- The most important product feature is easy deployment by end users, removing any friction to getting started.

- The key to effective PLG packaging is a free version that allows users to try before they buy.

- Pricing should logically scale as users get more value; about 75% of PLG companies surveyed have a consumption-based pricing meter. Unlike the traditional enterprise software model, pricing should be easily calculable from the website to assuage fears about long-term costs.

- Since PLG companies rely on user-led product discovery and exploration, they need to drive traffic to their website through search, paid media, communities, influencers, and partners. They focus on end users, rather than traditional corporate buyers, through marketing tactics such as targeted advertising campaigns.

- While some observers believe a PLG strategy means companies can reduce sales and marketing spending to fund research and development, our analysis of public company data shows that primarily PLG companies spend more on both R&D and sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue (see Figure 4).
  This greater investment pays off—product-led companies see more revenue growth for every sales and marketing dollar spent.
