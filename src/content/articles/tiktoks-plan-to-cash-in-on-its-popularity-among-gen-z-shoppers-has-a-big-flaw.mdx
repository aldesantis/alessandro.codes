## Summary

New Gen-Z data shows TikTok tied with Instagram as the most influential social platform for ecommerce, but a big bet on livestream shopping is risky.

## Highlights
- A November [survey from the influencer-marketing company Izea](https://www.businessinsider.com/data-tiktok-influencer-marketing-product-sales-popular-gen-z-millennials-2023-4) found that Gen-Z and millennial consumers ranked TikTok as the best platform to promote a product with an influencer. It beat out both Instagram and YouTube in that survey.
