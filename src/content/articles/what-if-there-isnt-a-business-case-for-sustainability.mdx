## Summary

Many brands are trying to find a business case for sustainability, but some initiatives may not be financially beneficial. Companies like Ganni and Veja have taken bold steps to prioritize the planet, even if it means sacrificing profits. To truly embed sustainability into their operations, brands need to accept that these efforts often come with costs and risks.

## Highlights

- Until companies recognise and accept that sustainability won’t always produce a return on investment, they are likely to hold off taking decisive actions while they wait for the business case to materialise — which means that if it never does, the necessary steps may never be taken.
- “We need business leaders to step in and say [that] we will be at a competitive disadvantage for doing this until you make it law and we all are required to do it.”
