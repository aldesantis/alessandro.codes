## Summary

Headless brands are community-driven identities that lack centralized management, allowing users to create and share their own narratives. Bitcoin is a prime example, as it evolves through the contributions of many stakeholders without a single controlling entity. This decentralized approach empowers individuals to shape the brand, resulting in diverse narratives that collectively define its presence.

## Highlights

- So, if a brand isn’t the product, the copywriting, the mission statement, the founder’s vision, the designer’s aesthetics, or the employees’ actions, what is it? A brand is a cultural phenomenon that emerges only when these things come into contact with people. A brand lives in the minds of those who are aware of it.
- As a brand grows, it becomes more than a set of first impressions and associations. _Its reputation precedes it._ As impressions are shared across users and consumers, they often develop similar sentiments. In this way, **a brand operates as a consensus system, facilitating a consistent set of beliefs across people.**
- Since the transition from broadcast to networked media, brands have become significantly more volatile. The internet dramatically reduced the barriers to publish, while enabling anyone to access published materials, which allowed any user to make their opinion known to any other.
- The fundamental tension of narrative control in the networked era is that most companies impose a hierarchical brand management model onto what has effectively become a distributed, permissionless process.
