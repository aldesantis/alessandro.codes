## Summary

The Alexander Technique helps you become aware of the space between reacting to stimuli and choosing a response, allowing for conscious decision-making. By expanding your awareness, you can enhance various aspects of your life, such as movement, performance, and relationships. This technique empowers you to gain control over your awareness and improve your overall well-being.

## Highlights

- _**Between stimulus and response there is a space**_. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.

- At its heart, Alexander Technique is a method to notice, expand and ultimately play within that space between stimulus and response.
- Awareness, on the other hand, is _the space that attention can move around within_. Awareness is the capacity, moment by moment, to be able to notice things that could be noticed.
