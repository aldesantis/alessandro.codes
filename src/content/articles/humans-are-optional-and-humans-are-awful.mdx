## Summary

Rosie Spinks worries that technology and algorithms make real human contact optional and erode our social skills. She finds hope in simple, messy face-to-face moments—like listening to people sing at a local club—that rebuild connection. Relearning how to engage with others is urgent for both personal life and democratic health.

## Highlights

- In our current moment, it takes actual effort to prioritize relationships with other people, even people you like. It’s an instinct that has been eroded, slowly and gradually, and then seemingly all at once. And it doesn’t seem like a coincidence that as social disconnection has increased in the last half century, [so too has political polarization](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/magazine/robert-putnam-interview.html?unlocked_article_code=1.sU8.Gfjg.Oz9eP-y7lypK&smid=url-share).
