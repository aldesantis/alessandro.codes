## Summary

To calculate your repeat rate, analyze transactions that took place in the last 12 months that have at least 6 months of tenure. I know that sounds confusing at first.

## Highlights

- a “good” repeat rate for a pure play eCommerce brand is 26-29%.
- • If your repeat rate is below 21%, you have merchandising issues that must be fixed if you want to grow profitably.
  - If your repeat rate is between 21-25%, your retention strategy needs work.
  - If your repeat rate is north of 38%, you might have a customer acquisition problem.
