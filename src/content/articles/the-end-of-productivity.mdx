## Summary

Why creativity is the new currency of success

## Highlights

- In a world where we can outsource productivity to technology, the people who reap the biggest rewards aren’t those who work the fastest.
  They’re the people who make things that are wonderful, original, weird, emotionally resonant, and authentic.
- There are two modes of information discovery: foraging and hunting. Foraging is passive. You don’t have a clear goal; you just wander and scroll until something catches your interest. Hunting is active and purposeful.
- When I have a piece of writing in mind, what I have, in fact, is a mental bucket: an attractor for and generator of thought. It’s like a thematic gravity well, a magnet for what would otherwise be a mess of iron filings. I’ll read books differently and listen differently in conversations.
