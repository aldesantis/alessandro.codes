#4: Strategic uncertainty

## Summary

Vaughn Tan’s newsletter discusses the importance of developing an “uncertainty mindset” to effectively handle unpredictable situations in both personal and organizational contexts. As uncertainty grows, those who can recognize and manage it will gain a strategic advantage, but traditional corporate training often fails to prepare employees for this challenge. To foster this mindset, organizations should encourage flexible roles and ongoing adaptation, allowing teams to respond better to unexpected demands.

## Highlights

- It will soon become a tired trope of this newsletter that our default modes of education and organization are moving us individually and collectively in the direction of being unable to handle uncertainty and of denying its existence—even as the world becomes more uncertain around us. The upshot is that being able to recognize and handle uncertainty is both important and strategic for both individuals and organizations.
- unique. In every organization that is exposed to external uncertainty (as is inevitably the case in the technology industry), a small group of often isolated employees eventually realizes that what they are doing is soaking up uncertainty for everyone else.
- **Unknown-ness in causality:** When the relationship between actions taken and outcomes intended is not known. Complexity can create this form of unknown-ness. For instance, the more complex a system, the more likely that action taken on the system has unanticipated (or unanticipatable) consequences due to the proliferation of interactions between its parts (e.g., central bankers trying to stimulate national economies). Insufficient experience can also lead to unknown-ness in causality (e.g., when a seasoned winemaker can make wine under challenging conditions because she “had a vintage a lot like this back in 1972”).
