## Summary

The apocalypse, it turns out, isn’t fire and brimstone. It’s revelation itself: the endless cataloging of all things until mystery dies.

## Highlights

- Curation isn’t just about sorting through slop anymore and ensuring I get the good stuff. It’s a about which good stuff is the most important.
- Arbitrage is at hand if something has been contentified before but is lost to the collective consciousness. The myth already exists.
- Everything is recorded for consumption at scale, and its shelf life is becoming exponentially shorter and less meaningful.
- If you want to build a brand and not recycle derivative and packaged experiences until they’re nothing more than echoes of life, do things that the algorithm can’t pick up.
