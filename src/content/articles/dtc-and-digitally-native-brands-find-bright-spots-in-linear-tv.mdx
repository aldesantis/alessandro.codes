## Summary

Digitally native brands are finding success in linear television as a way to diversify away from platforms like Facebook and Google. Direct-to-consumer brand Coterie has invested in linear TV and found that it offers a competitive cost per acquisition compared to Facebook. While Coterie still spends the majority of its advertising budget on digital platforms, linear TV is taking a larger share of incremental media spend. Linear TV offers performance-oriented brands a chance to reach audiences that may not be on social platforms, and it can be cheaper than streaming television. Linear TV’s unsophisticated targeting can reach people that algorithms wouldn’t touch. DTC brands are embracing linear TV earlier in their growth, and while CTV is growing faster, linear TV is still seen as a strategic avenue for advertising.

## Highlights

- Linear, by its unsophisticated targeting, is reaching people that those algorithms wouldn’t touch.
- Long-term, only having a linear TV capability is a strategic weakness,” Goyal said. “We’re going to need to crack CTV at some point. But it seems like the order of operations—for us, at least—is cracking linear TV first and then moving to CTV, versus the other way around.”
