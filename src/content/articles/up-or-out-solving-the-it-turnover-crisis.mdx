## Summary

The IT industry faces a high turnover crisis, as talented developers often leave companies after reaching their peak growth. To address this, companies should embrace a “culture of quitting,” allowing employees to leave on good terms and fostering an alumni network. This approach can help retain talent longer and improve training for new hires.

## Highlights

- Let’s not ignore the elephant in the room: employees will quit. No matter what you say, no matter what cushiony benefits you give, no matter how hard you try, they will leave you. It’s just a matter of “when”.
- A company with a culture of quitting does not have _ex-employees_; they have _alumni_. This is far more than a semantic distinction. An alumni relationship is positive; something that people can take pride in; and one that keeps the door open for further opportunities on both ends. Let’s face it; we’re already curious about our former workplaces and try to keep up through former coworkers. It’d be that much easier if the company facilitated this in some manner.
