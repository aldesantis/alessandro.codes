  **Amplify**: Amplify the consequences of not addressing the problem.
  **Story**: Share a relatable story or example that illustrates the problem.
  **Transformation**: Offer a solution that transforms the situation.
  **Offer**: Present your product or service as the key to achieving the transformation.
  **Response**: End with a clear call-to-action that encourages people to take the next step.
