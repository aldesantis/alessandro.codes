## Summary

Brand ROI means measuring how well your brand performs using key metrics like awareness, reach, and customer loyalty. You can track these using surveys, software tools, and analytics from social media and web platforms. Regular measurement helps understand your brand’s impact and improve marketing efforts.

## Highlights

- Here is a bit more context into each of these categories as well as some of the main KPIs that you’ll look at within each:
  - Awareness — Brand awareness is the market’s ability to recognize your brand name.
  - KPIs:
  - Aided and unaided recall
  - Share of voice
  - Reach / Impressions — Reach is the number of people who come in contact with your brand across your various channels and touchpoints.
  - KPIs:
  - Brand reach
  - Branded keyword search
  - Perception — Perception is what customers believe a company represents. Positive perception can earn your brand the “benefit of the doubt” in a purchase decision.
  - KPIs:
  - Sentiment
  - Consideration — Consideration measures how many people who are aware of your brand would actually consider making a purchase with your brand.
  - KPIs:
  - Direct traffic
  - Referral traffic
  - Preference — Preference measures how likely people are to choose your brand over another competitor brand.
  - KPIs:
  - Competitive win rate
  - Win/loss analysis
  - Brand-influenced acquisition
  - Loyalty — Loyalty describes a customer’s dedication to repeatedly purchasing from and engaging with a brand.
  - KPIs:
  - Customer satisfaction score (CSAT)
  - Product reviews
  - Advocacy — Advocacy measures how many people would recommend your brand to others based on the experiences they’ve had with your brand.
  - KPIs:
  - Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- To get a baseline, we recommend looking at the past 90 days of historic data. This way, you’re not going to have a baseline that is inflated by an outlier week where the KPI was super high, and you can more reliably set targets for longer periods of time, knowing how the metric has moved over multiple months rather than just a couple days or weeks.
- The tl;dr for target-setting is this:
  - A safe stretch goal is to increase your KPI by 10-20 percent from its baseline, quarter-over-quarter.
  - If your starting number is smaller, you should aim for a higher percentage increase. If your starting number is already quite big, then aim for a lower percentage increase. (Math, phew!)
- • Brand awareness – The % of people who know or recognize your brand name and what you stand for
  - Brand reach – The number of people who see your brand across your various channels and touchpoints
  - Branded keyword search – The number of people who are typing your brand name into Google
  - Website traffic – Web traffic that comes from brand sources like direct, referral, campaigns, and branded keywords
  - Share of voice – The number of times your brand is mentioned on a channel relative to the number of times your competition is mentioned
- Example brand survey:
  1. When you think of [your product category], which product comes to mind first? (Open text)
  2. Which of the following [your product category] products have you heard of? Choose all that apply. (Multiple choice, with a list of your company alongside your top competitors)
  3. Have you purchased or used a [your product category] product in the last 12 months? (Yes / No)
  4. If yes, which of the following [your product category] products have you used in the past 6 months? Choose all that apply. (Multiple choice, same list as from the aided recall question)
  5. On a scale of 1-5 (with 5 being high), how would you rate [your brand name] on the following attributes? (Matrix with a list of the attributes that are important to your brand perception)
  6. How would you describe [your brand name] to a friend or colleague? (Open text)
  7. Where have you seen or heard about [your brand name] recently? (List of marketing channels that are relevant to your brand strategy)
  - Digital ads
  - Social media
  - Partnership with an influencer
  - Word of mouth / personal recommendation
  - News / publicity
  - Partnership with another brand
  - App store
  - Nowhere
- Track the traffic to your blog. This will give your brand credit for your content, your SEO, and your thought leadership. If you want to get hyper-specific on brand content alone (say, for instance, that content and SEO live under your growth team), then only count traffic to certain categories of posts on your blog that are more TOFU and thought leadership.
- • Track the traffic to your careers page and job listings because that indicates strength of employer brand.
  - Track the traffic to your marketing site and landing pages that can be attributed to branded keyword search, referral traffic, and/or direct traffic.
- When counting video impressions, you count the number of views / plays, not just people who watched all the way through or to a certain point. Remember: we are looking for how many people our brand reached, not how many people stuck with us for a certain amount of time.
