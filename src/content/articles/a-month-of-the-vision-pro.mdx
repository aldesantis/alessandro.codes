## Summary

The Vision Pro, a VR/AR device, marks Apple’s entry into this evolving technology space. Apple and Meta approach the future of computing differently, with Apple focusing on AR for a general computing experience while Meta emphasizes VR and gaming. The Vision Pro is seen as a polished prototype rather than a consumer product, offering a glimpse into the potential of immersive computing experiences. Questions remain about the device’s purpose and whether it can lead to a universal computing device, with considerations about user adoption and market size in comparison to smartphones.

## Highlights

- Apple’s answer, I think, is that we begin with the user-cases we already have on other devices, and then, over time, developers will invent new things that are native to the form. That’s what happened with mobile: we began with the web and mail, and truly mobile-native things came later.
- However, I don’t think the future of computing is seeing several apps at once. I don’t think the future of productivity is seeing more rows in your spreadsheet, or more emails at once, or more records in Salesforce at once, on one big screen. I think the future, as seen for the last 20 or 30 years, is task-specific UIs that reduce complexity and data overload and focus on what you need to see. And obviously, I think the future is AI systems that show you less and tell you more.
