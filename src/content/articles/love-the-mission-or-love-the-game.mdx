## Summary

Entrepreneurial type can be categorized into two types: those driven by a passion for a specific mission and those motivated by the game of entrepreneurship itself. Type I entrepreneurs are inspired by a problem or idea and are deeply committed to turning their vision into reality. Type II entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are obsessed with the game of building a business and enjoy the process of creating something from nothing. There is also a third category, Type III, which includes entrepreneurs who do not have a strong love for either the mission or the game. Identifying one's entrepreneurial type has implications for idea selection, career arc, and how one approaches their role as a founder/CEO.

## Highlights
- The way I see it, there are two types of true entrepreneurs. There are those in it for the love of the mission that they’re obsessed with championing. And there are those in it for the love of the game of entrepreneurship itself, almost irrespective of the mission of the business.
- We like Type I stories even when there’s a Type II reality behind them. Type I stories say we are selfless rather than selfish. Or so we hope.
