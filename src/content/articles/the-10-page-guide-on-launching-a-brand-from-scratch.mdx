## Summary

If you’re reading this, I hope you’re relaxing with your feet up, your arms rested on an arm rest, and a beverage in your hand.

## Highlights

- DM 50-100 influencers in your niche on Instagram, Twitter, or TikTok. I said Twitter because some large creators on IG have really small Twitter followings and it’s easier to reach them there where their DMs aren’t flooded. Ask if they would like to try your product or participate in an influencer campaign by sharing a few paid posts.
  Collect their rates and enter them into a google spreadsheet.
  Analyze their followers and engagement rate and review their fees. Use your best judgment to pick the top 5 influencers that you think have the best prices for their respective engagement rates or are the most “on brand” for your niche.
- Send post purchase surveys, ask for reviews and offer a discount off their next order, tell customers that you are a small business and that their review could help change the trajectory of your brand. You need to be determined and persistent about getting this social proof as soon as possible in the early days.
- Choose a 3PL that isn’t venture backed and isn’t private equity owned when you’re just starting out. The 3PLs that are venture backed or PE owned are forced to raise prices by a TON to deliver returns. I’ve found that mom-and-pop 3PL shops will treat you better, have lower, more competitive prices, and take better care of you overall!

- IMO, you probably don’t need a 3PL until you are doing more than 50-100 orders/month.
