## Summary

“MVP” is a selfish process, abusing customers so you can “learn.” SLC is an alternate philosophy that results in fast, validated learning, that customers love.

## Highlights

- The customer should have a genuine desire to use the product, _as-is_. Not because it’s version 0.1 of something complex, but because it’s version 1.0 of something simple.
