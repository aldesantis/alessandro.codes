## Summary

Audience Capture is a phenomenon where an audience has hypnotized or captured a creator, and it is becoming increasingly prevalent in the age of social media. The constant exposure to the opinions and judgments of others can lead to a loss of artistic integrity and a reliance on external validation. The document explores three core theories that contribute to Audience Capture: Cooley's Looking-Glass Self, Goffman's Presentation of Self, and Foucault's Village. It also provides 10 strategies for resisting Audience Capture, including recognizing that attention and fame do not bring true satisfaction, being selective about which audience feedback to consider, and focusing on building a niche community rather than trying to please everyone.

## Highlights
- In today’s social dilemma, our actions are “seen by all”... yet we never actually see an observer observing. An audience is always out there. Often, we receive a sweet morsel of feedback proving its existence — it conditions us. But always, we’re acting as if we’re watched.
- What would you rather have: 1,000 readers who won’t share your piece, or 10 readers who sing your praises from the top of a mountain? Or how about just one reader who’s willing to hire you? We only care about what we can measure, and only measure what’s available.
  Consider what numbers you’re holding yourself to.
- I once cringed when I received "unsubscription" notifications. Today I embrace them. I'm making something not for everyone — there's *distinction*.
