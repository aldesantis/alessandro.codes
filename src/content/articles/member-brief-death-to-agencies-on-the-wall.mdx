## Summary

Some people believe that agencies are becoming less relevant in today’s fast-paced eCommerce world, leading to the phrase “Death to Agencies.” However, agencies still play a crucial role by offering deep knowledge and personal relationships that technology cannot replicate. To thrive, agencies must evolve by focusing on customization and strategic partnerships with their clients.

## Highlights

- Many of the agencies I come across recently have taken to being platform-agnostic, meaning they don’t tie their fortunes to a single ecosystem but rather offer expertise spanning across them, thus helping clients navigate subtle and sometimes quite not-so-subtle philosophical differences between them.
- Besides, agencies tend to be at their best when they transcend the transactional nature of client work. The most successful ones actually position themselves as strategic partners, embedding themselves in the operations of their clients and keying their goals to long-term outcomes. They aren’t just building websites; they’re helping companies reimagine their approach to commerce.
- At a time when platforms are scaling, agencies need to double down on customization and personal connection. They should know their clients’ businesses better than their clients know them, understand what they need next, and provide solutions before the problems arise.
