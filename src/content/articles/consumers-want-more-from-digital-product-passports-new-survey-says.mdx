## Summary

Luxury consumers want more information on the origins and attributes of their goods through digital product passports. Brands have an opportunity to enhance loyalty by providing features like authentication, repair information, and resale capabilities. These passports are set to become mandatory in the EU by 2030 and could revolutionize how consumers engage with luxury products.

## Highlights
- The five attributes consumers said they’d be most likely to use, each ranking at least 80 per cent or more, are product information, certificates of authenticity, aftercare and repair instructions, warranty information and resale information.
- One of the most significant logistical issues is ensuring that product information is readily available in terms of traceability of the supply chain, Ott says, and then brands need to decide which DPP provider to use, which data connector will be used (such as vision AI, QR code or NFC chip) and how they will communicate the benefits to consumers.
