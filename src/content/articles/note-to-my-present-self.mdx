## Summary

After years climbing the corporate ladder, the author quit to buy back time and presence. He now wanders with purpose, doing small meaningful things that don’t scale. Contentment comes from being present with family and simple daily rituals.

## Highlights

- At 25, I traded time for experience.
  At 35, I traded time for impact.
  At 45, I’m finally understanding that time isn’t something you trade - it’s all you actually have.
- Don’t trade money you don’t need for time you don’t have.
- Wandering isn’t the same as being lost. Lost is not knowing where you are. Wandering is exploring without a fixed destination. One is panic, the other is possibility.
- Unscalable things resist corruption by external rewards. They remain yours. Pure. Authentic.
