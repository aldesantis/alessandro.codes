## Summary

Amazon continues to move away from 1P sales to 3P sellers - sellers will comprise 60% of overall units sold by the end of the year. But the shift is gradual.

## Highlights

- Without the retail business as the first customer for fulfillment and advertising services, the marketplace wouldn’t have become key part of the flywheel it is today. But that flywheel could work without it today.
