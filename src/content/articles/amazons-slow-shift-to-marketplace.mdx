## Summary

Amazon continues to move away from 1P sales to 3P sellers - sellers will comprise 60% of overall units sold by the end of the year. But the shift is gradual.

## Highlights
- Without the retail business as the first customer for fulfillment and advertising services, the marketplace wouldnâ€™t have become key part of the flywheel it is today. But that flywheel could work without it today.
