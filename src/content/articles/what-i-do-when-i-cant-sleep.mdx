## Summary

When I couldn’t sleep I trained myself to notice and name the things I liked, like scents or lines of writing.

Making those tastes explicit—by keeping lists and describing admired work—helped me understand and sharpen my creative instincts.

Using tools (even ChatGPT) to put my taste into words made my writing and choices clearer and more satisfying.

## Highlights

- Making what you like explicit is a powerful tool. It will help you articulate it to yourself and to other people. This will help you refine and make more of it.
- a full “description” of what gives an idea its flavor is the same thing as the idea itself. A summary, or compression of that idea, somehow takes some of this flavor away.
