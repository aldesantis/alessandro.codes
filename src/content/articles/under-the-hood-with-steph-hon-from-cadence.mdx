## Summary

This week we have an Under The Hood with Steph Hon, founder and CEO of Cadence. Steph is an incredible founder and has built a very meaningful brand in Cadence.

## Highlights

- Control the controllables and give it 101% every single day. I would also say something tangible is persistence. Straight up persistence. If youâ€™re having a shitty day, let yourself feel like shit, but give yourself a time limit.
