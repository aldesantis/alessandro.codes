## Summary

Run clubs grow fast because they offer community and connection, not just exercise. Brands can learn to support existing groups and create real-life, consistent experiences for customers. Sharing fun, social moments helps brands build loyalty and stay relevant.

## Highlights

- Brands showing up successfully in the running space have one big commonality – they support, rather than own, the occasion. They identify the grassroots that have built these communities, and take on a supporting role rather than taking over. Brands don’t always need to generate new streams of consumer engagement but can work alongside existing ones – and still reap the benefits.
