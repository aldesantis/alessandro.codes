## Summary

The author explores the concept of productivity and its connection to biological health and purpose. Productivity is seen as a result of caring for your body and being passionate about your work. The key to productivity lies in prioritizing biological health, energy levels, and pursuing meaningful work.

## Highlights
- Productivity is largely upstream of your biological health and your sense of purpose.
- Importantly productivity is not about getting more done but producing more stuff that actually matters to you and others.
- Anything you put out into the world contains [traces of your energy when you created it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TNm8MJXKfc). All work is a form of energy transfer.
