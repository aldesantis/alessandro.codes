## Summary

Whatnot shows that live shopping works well when it focuses on entertainment and community, not just selling. It succeeds in special categories like collectibles and fashion, where trust and expertise matter. Live commerce is powerful but will likely stay a niche, not replace traditional online shopping.

## Highlights

- Amazon built live streaming as a sales tool - hosts demonstrate products, answer questions, and guide viewers toward purchase decisions. The format feels like an infomercial embedded in a shopping site designed for search, not browsing.
  Whatnot built the opposite: an entertainment platform where commerce happens to occur. For example, when sellers “break” open cases of trading cards on camera, they’re not just selling products – they’re hosting events.
- This entertainment-first approach explains why Whatnot works where broader live commerce efforts have struggled. The platform’s core categories – trading cards, sports memorabilia, coins – benefit from the format’s inherent advantages: real-time authentication, community validation, and the drama of auction-style reveals. These aren’t products that benefit from Amazon’s search-optimized listings or eBay’s static auction format. They require the kind of expertise and theater that live streaming provides.
- The question isn’t whether live commerce works - Whatnot proved it does. It’s whether that success can scale beyond passionate communities and impulse-driven categories to become a meaningful alternative to search-based shopping.
