## Summary

Mytheresa has successfully made luxury e-commerce profitable by focusing on acquiring high-value customers and understanding their long-term value. The company avoids rapid growth and discounting strategies, instead curating a tight selection of top brands to enhance customer experience. Despite challenges from the pandemic and competition, Mytheresa aims to expand its presence in key markets like the US and China while maintaining its disciplined approach.

## Highlights
- “We haven’t found a way to make it profitable,” admitted LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault at the group’s 2019 results presentation in January, referring to its e-tailer 24S. “All of them are losing money,” he said of competitors. “The bigger they are, the more money they lose.”
- Now part of the troubled Neiman Marcus Group, Mytheresa generated €377 million in revenue in the year ending in June 2019, up 24.7 percent year-on-year, while growing EBITDA — or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, a measure of operating profit — by 50 percent.
- Mytheresa is not targeting aspirational shoppers who purchase a trendy piece and never come back. It’s after wealthy fashion lovers who have a high propensity to become valuable long-term clients. Typically, they are cash-rich but time-poor, and value curation and convenience.
- “It’s really not finding the one algorithm; it's the ability to constantly work on this,” said Kliger. “Ten years ago, a person who looked at sneakers would have perhaps not been a luxury customer. Five years ago, someone that looked at a certain brand would have said, ‘That's too classic.’ And now the same brand is extremely fashion-forward. So, the clues are not constant.”
- But the company’s laser focus on serving a specific, high-value customer has resulted in a clearly defined, high-end positioning and tightly curated, highly productive buys. “Sixty-five percent of the business is based on 30 top brands,” said retail consultant Robert Burke.
