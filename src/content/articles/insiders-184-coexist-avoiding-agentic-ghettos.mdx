## Summary

What happens when your shopping companion isn’t constrained by human psychology at all? What happens when commerce needs to respond not just to different devices, but to different species of intelligence?

## Highlights

- Just as we once had to rebuild our interfaces to be “mobile-responsive,” we must now make them “agent-responsive.” But this shift goes deeper than any before it: it represents the first time humans will truly share commerce channels with non-human participants.
- Systems must seamlessly adapt between human and agent interactions, recognizing and responding to each appropriately. Just as the Google Assistant knows when to make a voice call versus send a text, commerce platforms must flex between attention-guided and parallel-processing modes.
- Platforms must be able to translate between human intent (often emotional, contextual, and imprecise) and agent intent (structured, specific, and programmatic). This bidirectional translation layer is crucial for hybrid interactions.
