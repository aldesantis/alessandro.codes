## Summary

Not-knowing means the different ways we lack complete knowledge or control in life. It is more common now because the world is more connected and complex. Learning to accept and understand not-knowing can help us make better decisions and be happier.

## Highlights

- Looking closely at the fog we’ve all been in for the last few years, it seemed to me that there are at least **four different types of not-knowing** that are not formal risk:
  1. [Not-knowing what **actions** we can take to achieve particular outcomes](https://vaughntan.org/not-knowing-about-actions-and-outcomes);
  2. [Not-knowing what concrete **outcomes** are possible](https://vaughntan.org/not-knowing-about-actions-and-outcomes);
  3. [Not-knowing about the **causal linkage** between particular actions and particular outcomes](https://vaughntan.org/causal-not-knowing);
  4. [Not-knowing about the **relative value** of particular outcomes.](https://vaughntan.org/not-knowing-about-value)
