## Summary

The text explores the concept of “research as leisure activity,” highlighting how it involves intellectual inquiry driven by passion and interest, not limited to traditional institutions. It emphasizes the idea of conducting research for enjoyment, connecting existing interests with new ideas, and fostering a community of curious individuals engaged in non-comprehensive education within various domains.

## Highlights

- The idea of **research as leisure activity** has stayed with me because it seems to describe a kind of intellectual inquiry that comes from idiosyncratic passion and interest. It’s not about the formal credentials. It’s fundamentally about _play_. It seems to describe a life where it’s just _fun_ to be reading, learning, writing, and collaborating on ideas.
- Wildenhaus’s description has stayed with me because it reflects how the best software products aren’t just assemblages of _functionality_, exposed by particular formal elements (links, buttons, icons, menus). Rather, they organize and shape how you think, and they create or sustain a particular lifestyle
- I truly think that autodidacts are responsible for all that is good and great about alternative culture.
- When research is your leisure activity, you’ll end up making connections between your existing interests and new ideas or topics. Everything gets pulled into the orbit of your intellectual curiosity.
