## Summary

I hope you’re sitting back, relaxed, have your feet up and a beverage in your non-dominant hand. Today I’m sipping on Boba Guys tea (they’re the greatest).

## Highlights
- ROAS simply tells you how much revenue you generated in proportion to how much you spent on digital ads. Whereas, **Net Contribution Profit** tells you how much PROFIT you generated on a product-by-product basis (with every possible expense considered).

- AOV minus CAC isn’t exactly the right metric to study to acquire customers sustainably. Instead, you want CAC to be equal to or below the net contribution profit per order to make sure you can achieve a sustainable (and profitable) spend for your brand.
