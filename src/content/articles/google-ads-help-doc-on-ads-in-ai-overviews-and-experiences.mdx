## Summary

Google has released a new help document about Ads in AI Overviews, explaining how ads can appear alongside AI-generated search results. Advertisers can reach customers in new ways as ads can show above, below, or within these AI Overviews based on user queries. This feature aims to help users find relevant businesses and products quickly, enhancing their search experience.

## Highlights

- Example: When a user searches for “why is my pool green and how do I clean it” they may see an AI Overview with suggestions to test your pool water or clean the pool by removing debris or vacuum. While this user query may not be directly commercial, our understanding of the user query + content in the AI Overview helps us detect that there could be commercial intent in this user journey, and serve relevant ads from our Search and Shopping ads inventory for “pool vacuum cleaners” to help the user take the next step. These are new opportunities for advertisers to connect with users in their journeys of discovery on Search.
