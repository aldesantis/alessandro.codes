## Summary

Yancey Strickler, cofounder of Kickstarter and Metalabel, emphasizes the importance of offline thinking in his creative process. He uses a butcher paper scroll to visualize ideas and encourages others to avoid over-reliance on AI, as it can hinder original thought. Strickler’s current project, Metalabel, fosters collaboration among creatives with an egalitarian structure and innovative practices like metablogging.

## Highlights

- Don’t outsource your thinking. Don’t reduce yourself to being another model. You possess the most important ability of all: to create life, with our bodies, our spirits, and our minds. Don’t squander it.
