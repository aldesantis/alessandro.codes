## Summary

Liquid Death, Stories & Ink and Gymshark—all started as D2C—have never solely relied on social.

## Highlights

- The once-linear purchase funnel has [collapsed](https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/your-organization-needs-an-updated-revenue-model/), making consistent and compelling brand stories matter more than ever. Instead of seeing a direct equation in which Brand + Ads = Customers, brands today need to think like a media company that creates engaging, useful content that speaks to audiences in meaningful ways.
- The best brands are unique, recognizable propositions that genuinely add value across multiple channels; they enhance people’s lives by building communities on and offline, operating in areas people really care about and helping to define their personality.
- When it comes to community-led, omnichannel approaches, it’s your brand story that ties everything together. It not only gives you a compelling message, it ensures you stay on message wherever your brand is present. And stories are one of the things people have been drawn to for millennia.
