## Summary

A blog post that deconstructs how to be a great spoken storyteller. How do you make an audience lean in?

## Highlights

- Talented storytellers know something bad storytellers don’t: storytelling is **the art of strategically withholding information.** Before you begin your story, you’re supposed to decide which details to **withhold** until the end—to maximize suspense along the way.
- The best storytellers put the work in before you hear them speak.
  The storyteller’s craft is therefore in making that prep work invisible. This is important: You never want to memorize your words. You only memorize key points then you rediscover the rich details and spontaneous turns of phrases in real time. This produces pauses, moments of self-reflection, and false starts.
- In other words, storytelling is not only the art of strategically withholding information, it’s also the art of time dilation.
- The more I listened to vocal variation, the clearer it became that **spoken storytelling is a form of music**. You talk. Then faster. You go silent. You strike with fast staccato sentences. The audience feels pressured on their heels. Then you slow down to quiet your voice. Now they relax. A sigh of relief.
- I noticed that charisma is the state of projecting three qualities at once: **confidence** + **joy** + **love for your audience**. When you embody all three, you put listeners at ease.
- For you to drop your self-consciousness so that a crowd drops theirs, you have to embrace what theater coach Konstantin Stanislavski calls “public solitude,” which is the ability to behave like you’re alone when you’re in front of a room full of people staring at you.

- In contrast, I noticed that the most likeable storytellers appeared to be **smiling—in their minds—when speaking**. But you didn’t **see** it on their faces—that can feel inauthentic. Instead, you felt the joy in their words.
  So I tried this myself: when speaking, in my mind’s eye, I imagined I was smiling from ear to ear.
