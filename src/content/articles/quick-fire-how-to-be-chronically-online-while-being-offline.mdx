## Summary

Bottega Veneta has become a top luxury brand in 2024 without having any social media accounts. Instead of focusing on online trends, they engage with culture through unique in-person events and collaborations. This strategy allows them to stand out authentically in a crowded digital landscape.

## Highlights
- In a world increasingly plagued by feed fatigue, the battle to stand out on social media has become often devoid of any real meaning. What Bottega has achieved is a successful protest against a near-futile battle to earn attention, instead channelling its creative energy and resource into IRL activations that engage with The Culture in more meaningful ways.
- rather than observing and following online trends, brands are fully capable of creating their own, treating social media culture as its peer and equal, rather than a source of culture-mining.
- Let this be a reminder to brands (and the rest of us) to operate from a place of creative abundance, not scarcity. To channel energy into longevity, not hype. And to be brand brutalist, with core values that stay holy and creative expression that invites true blasphemy.
