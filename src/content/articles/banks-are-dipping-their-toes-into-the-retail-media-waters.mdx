## Summary

Financial institutions like JPMorgan Chase are stepping into retail media, selling ads based on customer transaction data to compete with tech and retail players. Chase’s move leverages its vast customer base and first-party data, marking the start of a new wave in retail media that may see more banks follow suit. The rise of retail media is fueled by shifts in user tracking policies, with companies like Chase aiming to tap into the growing market for targeted advertising.

## Highlights

- “This was inevitable because financial companies have access to some of the best first-party data,” according to Andrew Lipsman, an independent media analyst at Media, Ads + Commerce. “It’s like dominos. The first one had to fall. And now that Chase has announced this, you’ll see other banks and financial companies start to fall, as well.”
- Retail media will account for one-fifth of U.S. ad spend in 2024, according to a [forecast](https://www.advertiserperceptions.com/retail-media-will-represent-a-fifth-of-us-ad-spending-in-2024/) by market intelligence firm Advertiser Perceptions. Walmart’s global ad business [grew](https://www.modernretail.co/marketing/modern-retail-research-walmart-target-are-encroaching-on-amazons-retail-media-dominance/) by 28% in 2023 to $3.4 billion, while Amazon reported advertising sales growth of 27% year-over-over in its most recent earnings.
