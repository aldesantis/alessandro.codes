## Summary

The article discusses how the traditional metric of ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) has become less effective for e-commerce brands as they scale and diversify their advertising channels. Instead, it suggests focusing on TACOS (Total Advertising Cost of Sale) to better gauge budget allocation and overall business performance. Prioritizing customer experience and organic growth can also help brands unlock more budget for advertising and achieve better long-term success.

## Highlights

- In fact, TACOS - _Total Advertising Cost of Sale_ is calculated as: **(Total Ad Spend / Total Revenue) x 100.**
- The challenge is that for some brands, LTV rarely, if ever, exceeds 1.0. Unlike subscription models or products with strong organic multipliers, many items are bought for practical reasons, with little incentive for repeat purchases. In these cases, **CPA and ROAS together offer a clearer view of profitability** as the brand scales their ads.
