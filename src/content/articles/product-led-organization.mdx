## Summary

A product-led organization focuses on building its entire business around its products, ensuring that all aspects like branding and marketing highlight product features. This approach helps maintain product differentiation and identity, even in competitive online marketplaces. Close collaboration among design, marketing, and retail teams is essential for creating a cohesive product universe that appeals to various customer personas.

## Highlights
- This model is these days exceedingly rare in retail, where companies churn a great number of unremarkable products differentiated only by their brand. Brand-driven product differentiation is a useful scaling mechanism - a brand is an umbrella for the countless product categories and SKUs - but is increasingly inefficient in online marketplaces. Even brands with loyal customers are not immune to commodification.
