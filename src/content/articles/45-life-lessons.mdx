## Summary

Khe Hy shares 45 lessons learned by age 45, highlighting the importance of balance in life, valuing experiences over possessions, and redefining success. He emphasizes the benefits of simplicity, purpose, and self-care, while acknowledging the challenges of time freedom and societal pressures. Ultimately, he encourages finding joy in small moments and prioritizing meaningful relationships.

## Highlights

- I used to only want to do something if I could be in the top 5% (of equally placed peers).
  You miss a lot of life if you live that way.
- I project a lot of things on others. “This person’s rich, but his wife probably hates him.”
  Or, “She’s a great writer, but she keeps getting these lucky breaks.”
  Each projection always contains a useful piece of info: **something I don’t like about myself.**
