## Summary

As TikTok Shop gears up for the holiday season, the social media app is going all-in on livestreaming to boost sales.

## Highlights
- “Step by step, we are moving away from it and having more brands funding their own discounts,” Le Bourgeois said. “As they understand the power of TikTok, the size of the audience that we offer, everybody’s excited to actually step in and go big on discounts.”
- Although live shopping is still a nascent part of the e-commerce market in the U.S., it’s expected to grow 25% in China to [$703 billion](https://www.emarketer.com/content/tiktok-determined-make-live-shopping-mainstream-while-amazon-leans-shoppable-tv) this year. Still, it remains to be seen if TikTok’s bet on live shopping will pay off, as only 14% of adults in the U.S. have bought something from a livestream event, according to eMarketer.
- “These brands… have huge legal teams and want to cross every ‘T’ and dot every ‘I’ — with lives, you can say or do one thing off-script, and then it’s a compliance issue,” the person said. “Going live creates a lot of question marks and what ifs.”
