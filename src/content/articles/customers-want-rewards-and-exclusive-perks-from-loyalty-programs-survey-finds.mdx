## Summary

Customers highly value loyalty programs that offer rewards, exclusive perks, and personalized gifts like birthday treats. These programs influence customer decisions and increase spending, with many consumers joining before their first purchase. Brands are focusing on simplifying programs and offering cash-back rewards to meet customer preferences and drive loyalty.

## Highlights

- The study found that the top feature customers want from a program is the ability to earn rewards points toward discounts, bonuses or exclusive merchandise. Customers also want exclusive treatment, whether thatâ€™s by earning discounts only available to members or gaining access to exclusive perks, such as free shipping.
- There are traps with rewards. Snappy found that the most common rewards program pitfalls include complicated redemption processes, unattractive rewards and invaluable incentives.
