## Summary

The Internet could become your most powerful asset, if only you were using it correctly. In Write of Passage, I teach a proven system to write online that’s built for the 21st century. I’ve distill…

## Highlights
- If you capture ideas when they’re in the forefront of your mind, you won’t have to pray for them to come back when it’s time to write.
    - Tags: [[writing]] 
- It’s easier to have unique ideas when you read things other people don’t.
    - Tags: [[writing]] 
- When you practice the habit of capturing what’s already happening, you’ll find that you have all the material you need to start writing.
    - Tags: [[writing]] 
- The clarity of memory decays quickly, so we shouldn’t just save other people’s ideas. We should save our own ideas too. Until we have a central place to capture our best thinking, the joy of epiphany will turn into the anxiety of forgetfulness.

- If you’re stuck on writing, look back at what you’ve already written for inspiration– emails, texts, tweets, group chats, and Slack Messages. Ask yourself: “Where have I been writing all along?”

- • Conversations with **friends** help us discover surprising ideas that are worth exploring.
  • Conversations with **readers** tell us if an idea will resonate with our audience.
  • Conversations with **editors** help us improve how our ideas are delivered.

- “Friend Brain” is our natural way of speaking. It comes easily to us in conversation, and it knows how to party. It’s the friend your Mom warned you about — the one who was super mischievous and high-agency and gave you that intrepid spirit.

- Until you develop a form of low-grade telepathy, your best bet is to cultivate feedback. By doing so, your writing will have less fat and a hell of a lot more meat on the bone.

- Compressed writing doesn’t mean short (just look at the length of this guide!). It just means that the pacing is brisk and each word serves a unique purpose.
- A fraction of what you initially write will account for the majority of insight.

- Ideas that are novel but not surprising are the definition of trivia (which sounds a lot like trivial for a reason).

- You can buy attention, but you can’t buy trust. It has to be earned, and that’s what makes it so precious.
- The best self-promoters aren’t self-promoters. They take the time to become a genuine member of each community. Share others’ content. Write detailed comments. Make friends.
- Writing online without building an email list is like playing Monopoly, passing GO, and not collecting $200.

- Good writing has three components: it’s Personal, Observational, and Playful. Writing that feels stale is almost always lacking in one of these three dimensions.

- When writing is only observational, it’s boring. School textbooks come to mind because they are neither personal or playful.
- A shiny dime is the smallest viable idea you can write about.

- If you have a distinct voice, you don’t need to have all the answers because readers will enjoy going on the journey with you so much.
- You ain’t gonna think your way to finding your voice. Don’t get upset with your lack of progress until you’ve published at least 50 articles.

- Nobody has ever recommended a book because there weren’t any typos.
- Writing tools often lower variance which is good if you’re a bad writer and bad if you’re a good writer.

- A busy schedule will suffocate your spirit, but [free time is nuclear fusion for creativity](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1558117720180379648?s=20&t=3tD0VtUrBnkWreYtVxDKvg).

- If your ideas are boring, get a life. If you already have a life and your ideas are still boring, you’re not listening carefully enough.
