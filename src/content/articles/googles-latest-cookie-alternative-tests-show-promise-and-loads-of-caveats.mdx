## Summary

Shifting to interest-based solutions like the Topics API delivered a “relatively small” impact on performance, but the research parameters were limited.

## Highlights

- New research analyzing the performance of ads in Chrome when cookies were enabled versus when they were suppressed found that a mix of what Google terms “privacy-preserving signals,” including the tech giant’s Topics API, produced results that were relatively in line with the status quo marketers have come to expect from cookies, including on key metrics like click-through rates.

- Google revealed that an IBA-focused approach decreased ad spending within a range of 2-7% compared to a cookie-based approach. Conversions per dollar, which Taylor argued could serve as a proxy for advertising performance, experienced a 1-3% decrease in effectiveness. Click-through rates remained within 90% of the “status quo” seen with cookies.
