## Summary

Welcome to the Sociology of Business. In my last analysis, The creative economy, I analyzed how brands exploit time to make money.

## Highlights

- A lot of creative industries have been forced to accelerate their creative output, in the always-on cadence. Pressure for immediate productivity leads to unremarkable work, and is a reason for endless sequels, reissues, archive reboots and self-referencing across creative industries.
- Creativity is an approach, rather than just the output. As an approach, creativity focuses on business opportunities across corporate functions. As a strategy, creativity marries the process of idea generation and idea commercialization into organizational “middleware.”
- _In the domain of marketing_, creative strategy delivers a lot ideas versus just one “big” idea, and captures a lot of cultural moments versus just one “big moment.” Its purpose is to expand a brand’s footprint and renew brand associations and provide a stream of always-on entertainment. It tests and tries ideas in the world, where they live or die.
- A portfolio approach to idea generation is supported by marketing spend that is considered an investment and a cost of goods sold rather than as an operating expense, an approach that allows them to set realistic expectations on the investment returns. Additionally, creative strategy manages a company’s intellectual property, ensuring that brand content and entertainment is consistently monetized.
- Creative strategy uses media for interstitial storytelling, which refers to a series of mini-stories that are connected into a web of a wider narrative. Creative strategy defines the cadence of messaging to mimic movie releases, through teasers, trailers, marketing activations, merch, events and launches
- _In the domain of design_, creative strategy ensures a consistent implementation of a signature brand aesthetic. A clearly defined brand aesthetics is how a brand participates in culture, and is told through product design, fashion direction, and styling.
