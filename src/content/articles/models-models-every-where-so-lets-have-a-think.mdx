## Summary

The author discusses two fields: resilience engineering and formal methods, which both emphasize the importance of creating explicit models to understand complex systems. While formal methods focus on analyzing software behavior, resilience engineering looks at mental models and how work is done in organizations. Both approaches aim for insight rather than completeness, helping us better understand systems by highlighting aspects often overlooked.

## Highlights

- You’ll often heard the short-hand phrase _**work-as-imagined vs work-as-done**_ to get at this modeling, where it’s the _work-as-done_ that is the model that we’re after. The resilience engineering perspective asserts that the documented processes of how work is supposed to happen is not an accurate model of how work actually happens, and that the deviation between the two is generally successful, which is why it persists.
