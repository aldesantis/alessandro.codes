## Summary

This edition of Cocktails & Commerce features a Thanksgiving dessert cocktail called Gracias en La Vi√±a, inspired by classic flavors. It also discusses how businesses can improve their go-to-market strategies by developing a fresh narrative that connects with customers. The key to success lies in understanding customer needs and differentiating from competitors rather than simply increasing marketing efforts.

## Highlights
- Poor sales performance often really stems from misaligned product-market fit (for today), weak differentiation, or an outdated narrative and value proposition.
