## Summary

The document discusses how a loyalty program can provide incremental financial benefits to a company through four key measurements. These include comparing the value of members versus non-members, analyzing member behavior changes, leveraging partner funding, and increasing customer journey touchpoints. By implementing a well-structured loyalty program supported by a dedicated team, companies can see positive results in terms of revenue generation and customer engagement. The document emphasizes the importance of strategic planning, ongoing analysis, and continuous improvement to ensure the loyalty program’s success in driving financial value for the business.

## Highlights

- As a baseline, companies should keep in mind the financial value of customers who convert into members prior to joining and post joining to measure true incrementality to the business.
- In businesses with a varying margin mix, member contribution can also be determined by evaluating high margin product purchases. For example, if your members and non-members frequent your business similarly and spend similarly, but the loyalty members are influenced to purchase higher margin products, then the loyalty team truly is delivering incremental financial benefit.
- Loyalty touchpoints should be used as an enhancement to communicate personally and authentically to the consumer, nurturing a long-term relationship. These added touchpoints should range from communication welcoming them into the program to congratulating them for redeeming their rewards to celebrating special moments in their life like a birthday.
