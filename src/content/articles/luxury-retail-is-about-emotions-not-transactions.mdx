## Summary

Luxury retail, as described by Scott Malkin of Value Retail, focuses on creating emotional connections with customers rather than just transactions. Value Retail's shopping villages aim to provide a unique and special experience for luxury consumers, with a focus on joy and sophistication. By offering high-end clienteling services, unique experiences, and a blend of physical and digital innovations, the company strives to preserve the essence of luxury retail in a world where online efficiency can sometimes overshadow emotional connections in shopping experiences. The Bicester Collection, with its emphasis on customer experience and brand preservation, exemplifies the shift towards creating memorable and emotionally resonant shopping experiences for luxury consumers.

## Highlights
- the reason for physical retail, at any touchpoint, is the flagship experience: the presentation of the brand in all its glory.
