## Summary

The author of this article reflects on the decline of friendships and the challenges of making and maintaining meaningful connections, particularly in a hyper-connected but socially disconnected world. The author suggests that the demands of modern life and the emphasis on individualism and self-optimization have eroded the social capital and relational muscles necessary for building and sustaining friendships. The pandemic has only accelerated this trend, leaving many people feeling burned out, isolated, and craving the kind of low-effort, place-based friendships that have sustained humans for centuries. The author argues that we need to rediscover our social nature and invest in the basic human experience of relying on the people around us.

## Highlights
- Modern loneliness masks itself as hyper connectivity. And so people have easily 1000 virtual friends, but no one they can ask to feed their cat. That loneliness, which is really a depletion of the social capital, is extremely powerful.

- Friendships are, by their very nature, made of friction. To know what is going on in someone’s day-to-day life, to make plans with them, and then reschedule those plans when someone inevitably gets sick, and then bring over Calpol or soup or an extra laptop charger. To water their plants while they’re away, to ask them to take your kids when you’re feeling sad, or for help getting rid of mice in your house. To show up for the walk you planned even when you’re a vulnerable anxious mess — this is all friction.
- friction is not just interrupting your day or life to help out a friend, but also admitting you need the kind of help you cannot pay for or order yourself. To pierce through your veil of seamless productivity and having-it-together to say: I need something from you, can you help me?
- We are so burned out by our data-heavy, screen-based, supposedly friction-free lives that we no longer have the time or energy to engage in the kind of small, unfabulous, mundane, place-based friendships or acquaintance-ships that have nourished and sustained humans for literal centuries.
- We are so burned out by the process of staying afloat in a globalized, connected world that we simply don’t have the energy for the kinds of in-person, easy interactions that might actually give us some energy and lifeforce *back*.

- I’ve been comforted and energized by this idea — which I first heard in this [interview with the novelist Zadie Smith](https://open.spotify.com/episode/74WBcU7AWiQhAVTbSIXIB2?si=709682fe54ee4c5f) — that caretaking is a kind of liberation.
  It’s liberation from the idea that we can self-optimize ourselves to the point of not needing anyone else. That if we work hard enough to survive in a competitive economy, we’ll be able to buy, order, or summon anything we might need within 24 hours, and that is somehow progress. That instead of asking for help and support from the people and friends we know — they’re too burned out, don’t want to bother them, they live too far away — we should invest heavily in self care to inoculate ourselves from needing to ask anything of anyone.

    - Note: This resonates a lot. I am always very hesitant to ask anyone for help; I want to be autonomous and independent. This is probably a result of how I was raised.
