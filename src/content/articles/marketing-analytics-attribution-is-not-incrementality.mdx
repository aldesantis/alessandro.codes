## Summary

The ultimate holy grail of Marketing Analytics is measuring true incrementality. Yet, most confuse Marketing attribution with incrementality. Big Mistake.

## Highlights
- From there, it is a hop, skip, and a jump to, *hey, am I getting all the credit I should for the Conversions being driven by my marketing tactics?* AKA: **Attribution!**
  Right then and there, your VP of Finance steps in with a, *hey, how many of these conversions that you are claiming are ones that we would not have gotten anyway?* AKA **Incrementality!**

- Incrementality identifies the Conversions that would not have occurred without various marketing tactics.
  Attribution is simply the science (sometimes, wrongly, art) of distributing credit for Conversions.

- As you do **digital attribution** analysis, watch out for Paid Marketers who say they do attribution analysis but only count paid media channels. Work to help them, and your Senior Leaders, understand that this inflates paid marketing’s value well beyond what’s deserved.

- If you are using the full power of the attribution modeling across owned, earned, and paid, you are at an ***industry-average level*** of analytics sophistication.​
  If you have hooked up the owned, earned, and paid multi-channel attribution analysis results directly to platforms you are buying ads on to ensure smarter bidding, you are at an ***industry-leading level*** of analytics sophistication. ​

- Marketing’s Incrementality then is being able to identify how many of the 10 conversions would have happened anyway – even if you did no Marketing.

- Typically, if measured accurately, the true incrementality of your Marketing will be in the range of  0% to 25%.
