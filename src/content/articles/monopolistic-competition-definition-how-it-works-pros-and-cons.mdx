- In monopolistic competition, one firm does not monopolize the market and multiple companies can enter the market and all can compete for a market share. Companies do not need to consider how their decisions influence competitors so each firm can operate without fear of raising competition.
- In perfect competition, the product offered by competitors is the same item. If one competitor increases its price, it will lose all of its market share to the other companies based on market supply and demand forces, where prices are not set by companies and sellers accept the pricing determined by market activity.
