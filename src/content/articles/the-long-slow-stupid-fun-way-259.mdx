## Summary

Paul Millerd reflects on his journey of balancing fatherhood and writing, emphasizing a long, slow, and enjoyable approach to his creative work. He rejects the pressure to optimize for quick success or subscriber numbers, focusing instead on the joy of writing and personal growth. Millerd advocates for exploring unconventional life paths and finding fulfillment in the process rather than adhering to traditional metrics of success.

## Highlights

- Staying true to my inner creative drive and trusting that things will work out forced me to put faith in other people, see myself as part of a bigger community and world and think deeply about how I can be a more generous member of this world and my communities.
- I was explaining this to someone during a curiosity conversation and a phrase came out of my mouth, the “long, slow, stupid, fun game.” Here’s how I’d describe it.
  - **Long**: Focus on the meta-game of finding the work I want to keep doing indefinitely. Don’t get distracted by shiny objects.
  - **Slow**: Do things slowly. Start small and level up over time.
  - **Stupid**: Lean against obvious ways to make more money when you sense it’s not the thing that will matter over the long run.
  - **Fun**: Am I still having fun? Keep going. If not, quit, optimize, or scale back.
- Consulting was a fast and smart game. It was taking business problems and running them through a human-driven search function to land on the best practices, analyses, or mental models that increased profit. It’s one of the best games ever invented and has led to incredible prosperity. However, if you aren’t wired to play it on the highest level of difficulty, it often induces low-grade anxiety that people struggle to shake.
- The long, slow, stupid, and fun way rejects the dominant mode of play optimizing around extrinsic goals and in doing so opens one up to having to develop alternatives. Such a person is rarely a cutting-edge early adopter but is not a laggard either. They are willing to experiment with working on different things, in different ways, and using new kinds of tools as soon as the friction to getting started is reasonable. The whole goal becomes learning from doing and figuring out what it tells you about what to do next.
- The thing about his line is that there are plenty of ways to be regarded as successful in today’s world. The range of options is likely well beyond what he could have imagined. What would have shocked him, however, is that there are now billions of people and many of them fail to imagine different ways of doing the things they do.
