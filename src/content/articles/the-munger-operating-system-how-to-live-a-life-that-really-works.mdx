## Summary

In his commencement speech at USC Law School, Charlie Munger offers advice on how to live a successful life. His core ideas include earning trust, learning to love and admire the right people, and acquiring wisdom as a moral and practical duty. He also emphasizes the importance of attaining fluency on big multidisciplinary ideas and thinking through problems backwards as well as forward. Munger urges individuals to avoid self-pity, self-serving bias, and intense ideologies, and to work with and under people they admire. Finally, he encourages people to use setbacks as opportunities to become better individuals.

## Highlights

- It’s such a simple idea. It’s the golden rule so to speak: You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end.
- What I noted since the really big ideas carry 95% of the freight, it wasn’t at all hard for me to pick up all the big ideas from all the big disciplines and make them a standard part of my mental routines. Once you have the ideas, of course, they are no good if you don’t practice — if you don’t practice you lose it.
  So I went through life constantly practicing this model of the multidisciplinary approach. Well, I can’t _tell_ you what that’s done for me. It’s made life more fun, it’s made me more constructive, it’s made me more helpful to others, it’s made me enormously rich, you name it, that attitude really helps.
- If you’re unreliable it doesn’t matter what your virtues are, you’re going to crater immediately. So doing what you have faithfully engaged to do should be an automatic part of your conduct. You want to avoid sloth and unreliability.
- Generally speaking, envy, resentment, revenge and self pity are disastrous modes of thought. Self-pity gets pretty close to paranoia, and paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse. You do not want to drift into self-pity.
- And of course self-serving bias, you want to get that out of yourself; thinking that what’s good for you is good for the wider civilization and rationalizing all these ridiculous conclusions based on the subconscious tendency to serve one’s self.
- If you want to persuade, appeal to interest not to reason.
- Learn the all-important concept of assiduity: Sit down and do it until it’s done.
- Another thing of course is life will have terrible blows, horrible blows, unfair blows, doesn’t matter. And some people recover and others don’t. And there I think the attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every mischance in life was an opportunity to behave well, every mischance in life was an opportunity to learn something, and your duty was not to be submerged in self-pity but to utilize the terrible blow in a constructive fashion.
