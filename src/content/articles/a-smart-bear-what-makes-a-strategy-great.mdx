## Summary

Great strategy is characterized by simplicity, decisiveness, leverage, asymmetry, and a futuristic approach. A great strategy is simple, allowing for clear communication and understanding. It is also decisive, making self-consistent decisions and accepting the consequences. Leveraging strengths and assets is key, generating a large effect from a relatively small effort. Asymmetry is important, where the upside far exceeds the cost and the portfolio of bets comes out positive. Finally, a great strategy is futuristic, solving for the long-term.

## Highlights

- Great strategies accomplish this with the following characteristics:
  - **Simple:** Reshapes complexity to be manageable and actionable.
  - **Candid:** Dares to spotlight the most difficult truths.
  - **Decisive:** Asserts clear decisions _and_ accepts their consequences.
  - **Leveraged:** Magnifies strengths into durable competitive advantage.
  - **Asymmetric:** Defeats uncertainty with higher upside than downside.
  - **Futuristic:** Solves for the long-term.
- The world is complex, and therefore difficult to reason about. Strategy intentionally omits detail in exchange for clarity. Armed with a simple narrative, mere mortals can achieve understanding, and make every-day decisions that remain aligned to that narrative.
- Its job isn’t to be non-obvious, but rather to cleanly specify what is most important. It might be obvious to do X, but Y and Z are also “obvious,” so by selecting X and not Y nor Z, you have created focus, and specified “how to win.”
- The process of strategy _creation_ must indeed tackle the complexity of the world, but the _output_ of that process is a document that frees everyone else from having to re-solve every puzzle.
- Real threats are either happening now or are at least [70% likely to happen](https://longform.asmartbear.com/probability-words/). Real threats are specific, ideally backed by data that proves they are happening, e.g. your market is shrinking; a competitor has accelerating market share; cancellation rates prove that even paying customers don’t value the product. Real threats are written in the present tense because they are happening, not hypothetically with “could” or “might.”
- If you’re worried someone might leave the company when they hear how scary it is, maybe they _should_ leave the company. These _are_ the challenges we’re facing together; if they’re not willing to solve them, they need to make space for someone who will relish the challenge.
- There are both positive and negative second-order consequences of any complex decision. If these aren’t identified—in particular, if the problematic consequences aren’t embraced within the strategy—then it’s not a clear decision. When those consequences inevitably arise, the team must be able to say “we expected that” rather than “we have to address that” or even “this is a signal that the strategy is wrong.”
- A common tactic for avoiding making a decision is to use non-specific language. “We will leverage synergies to create unique solutions” is, in fact, a good thing to do, but it doesn’t specify which synergies to leverage, [what is unique](https://longform.asmartbear.com/worse-but-unique/) about it, or what the unique solution is. Fluffy language is a hallmark of indecisiveness, and therefore of bad strategy.
- Great strategy leverages the strengths and assets of the organization; a bad strategy asks the organization to win even while acting unnaturally, often under the cover of “overcoming weaknesses.”
- Great strategies prescribe activities that always move the company forward, despite the inevitable bad luck and setbacks. To do that, the activities must exhibit asymmetry, where the upside vastly exceeds the cost, so that even if you [took 2x longer to achieve 50% of what you expected](https://longform.asmartbear.com/roi-rubric/), you still win.
