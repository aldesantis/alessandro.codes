## Summary

Streetwear and NFTs have a strong connection, with both centered around community and status symbols. Brands like RTFKT and The Hundreds are merging digital art with fashion, creating popular NFT sneakers and apparel. As the NFT market grows, fashion companies are looking to authentically engage with this trend rather than just cash in on it.

## Highlights

- The affinity between the two spaces is no coincidence. Both thrive on hyped assets, driven by scarcity, that attract high prices on the secondary market and have become status symbols online. Beyond that, NFTs and streetwear in many ways share a similar sense of community â€” a part of the NFT boom often obscured by the focus on speculative investments in the space.
