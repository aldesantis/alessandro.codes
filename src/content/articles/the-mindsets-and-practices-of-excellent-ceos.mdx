## Highlights

- Excellent CEOs endeavor to minimize the effect of biases by instituting such processes as preemptively solving for failure modes (premortems), formally appointing a contrarian (red team), disregarding past information (clean sheet), and taking plan A off the table (vanishing options).

- Excellent CEOs commit to making the team productive by regularly taking stock of and improving its operating rhythm, meeting protocols, interaction quality, and dynamics.

    - Note: You become fast and stable through an operating cadence.
- Excellent CEOs increase their companies’ agility by determining which features of their organizational design will be stable and unchanging (such features might include a primary axis of organization, a few signature processes, and shared values) and by creating dynamic elements that adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities (such elements might include temporary performance cells, flow-to-work staffing models, and minimum-viable-product iterations).

- The best leaders reframe the reference point for success.
    - Note: Success means something different for everyone. Don’t play by the rules.
- Data shows that externally hired CEOs are more likely to move with boldness and speed than those promoted from within an organization.
