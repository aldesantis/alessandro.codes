## Highlights

- itch-scratching isn’t product-orientation. There is no good reason to believe that an itch represents a “dent in the universe” level of opportunity.  It may merely be a break-out-of-gridlock level of opportunity or a personal ticket out of frustration.

- By contrast, product-driven businesses expand markets in an absolute sense, create customers, and therefore wealth. They must be marketing-driven in a deep way: they “make people want things” rather than “make things people want.” This means they create and satisfy new needs and establish new patterns of behavior.
- This is why product-driven businesses tend to reverse yet another customer-driven business mantra: sell aspirin, not vitamins (i.e., sell to painful, immediate concerns that must necessarily be addressed, not to painless long-term concerns that perhaps don’t need to be). That wisdom, which is practically a Golden Rule for customer-driven businesses, is precisely what product-driven businesses don’t do.
- Customer-driven businesses discover novel-to-them patterns. Such stable but undetected patterns can only exist in two places: inside the closely guarded core of incumbent markets, where competitors are trying to obscure your understanding of patterns OR in the interstices and margins of existing markets where nobody previously thought to look, or looked but didn’t care about what they saw.
