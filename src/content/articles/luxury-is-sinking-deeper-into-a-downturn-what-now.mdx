## Summary

The luxury industry is facing a slowdown, particularly impacted by low consumer confidence in China and rising prices. While many brands are struggling, top luxury names like Hermès and Prada are still showing growth. Overall, the market is mixed, with some companies reporting positive results amidst the downturn.

## Highlights

- HSBC wrote in its note about “greedflation”, or “the idea that many brands went too high, too quickly in terms of price points”, explains Rambourg. “Seemingly, the value proposition is somewhat broken. You need to make a lot of effort to recreate stepping stones, more reasonable price points to reconnect with an alienated aspirational consumer.”
- LVMH’s Guiony dismissed any causal link between the current global luxury slowdown and the price increases implemented over the years. “There are not that many products that we sell today that were active in 2019. We have changed a lot of the product range. So price comparison is not that easy. And when it comes to increasing prices, actually it’s more a mix impact than a price impact. Secondly, all the players have done the same. Do you really think that if we had not increased prices the way we’ve done, we would be faring double digits today? I don’t think so […] So we are not necessarily having the view that we should change strategies [or] the offer drastically, to address the current situation,” he told investors.
- Don’t expect to see prices of existing products coming down. “Lowering prices is a ‘no-no’, because you will annoy customers who bought at the higher price. So the idea is to invest to justify the new price by feeding brand desirability,” Rambourg says. Instead, we may see luxury brands rethink their pricing architecture and offer new products at a lower price point, he suggests. “Vuitton was probably navigating well and the reason is they have a very broad portfolio. In tough times, you trade down from leather to canvas so they cater to all clients.”
- “Right now, equity markets are at an all-time high in the US and luxury demand is OK, but not really accelerating,” Rambourg says. “That’s probably linked to a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. The strength of the American consumer is to write the next chapter. Possibly the day after the election, people move on and start to spend again ahead of the all-important holiday season. So we do believe in a sequential acceleration of growth in the US linked to the fact that the event will be behind you and will see uncertainties being removed.”
