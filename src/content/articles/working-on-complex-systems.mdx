## Summary

Complex systems are different from complicated ones because they require unique solutions and can behave unpredictably. They often show characteristics like delayed consequences and nonlinearity, making them challenging to navigate. To manage complex systems effectively, it’s important to embrace adaptability, innovation, and observability.

## Highlights

- • **Complicated problems are intricate but predictable**. They followed structured, repeatable solutions. For example, filing taxes is complicated, but it’s a structured and conventional problem since the process remains mostly the same year after year.
  - **Complex problems are intricate but unique**. They require adaptive and often novel solutions. For example, climate change mitigation is a complex problem because it requires new and adaptive solutions and existing methods alone can’t really address its evolving challenges.
