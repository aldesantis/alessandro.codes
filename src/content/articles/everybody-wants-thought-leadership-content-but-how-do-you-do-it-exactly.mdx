## Summary

Thought leadership content is about sharing unique insights to build credibility and trust with your audience. It helps position your brand as an industry authority and can drive lead generation. Animalz offers services to help businesses create impactful thought leadership content.

## Highlights

- Instead, “thought leadership” is a long-term goal to work toward, which should influence everything from the topics you choose to your content approach — and often, even the formatting of each content piece.
- To become a thought leader, you need to **have** a unique perspective backed by the credibility of your experiences and expertise. And you need to **share** those ideas with your industry. That is your primary focus, because it’s in your control.
- Here are the five sources of thought leadership content:
  - Counter-narrative opinions
  - Personal narrative
  - Network connections
  - Industry analysis
  - Data storytelling
- You may be familiar with the phrase “[narrative violation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/style/narrative-violation-venture-capital-tech.html):” something, usually a company or product, that breaks from the consensus of how things are supposed to go.
- But anything worth saying can and should be said again and again because [anything worth hearing will need to be heard again and again](https://www.animalz.co/blog/auteur-theory/) before it truly sinks in. Get creative — even case studies and other standard content pieces can fit nicely into this repetition.
