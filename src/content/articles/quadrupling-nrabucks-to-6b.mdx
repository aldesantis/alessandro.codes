## Summary

Black Rifle Coffee is falling prey to the same mistakes that every other DTC darling made. Only strong leadership (we) can fix it.

## Highlights
- Now that cheap Meta CPMs are over, Retail margins arenâ€™t looking that bad. All the brands that were built on cheaper prices/cutting out the middleman are dead. Products still need to be priced for Retail-like margin structures. Now, they also need to be priced for DTC-onomics as well.
