## Summary

Before we begin, I just posted a podcast with Noah Kagan on how to find million dollar startup ideas in 2024.

## Highlights

- Accept pain, don’t suffer (pain is inevitable, suffering is optional)
- Overthinking —> Write
  Uninspired —> Read
  Scared —> Take one risk
  Stuck —> Walk
  Tired —> Sleep
  Confused —> Ask
  Frustrated —> Move
  Burned out —> Day off
  Impatient —>Review progress
  Unmotivated —> Remember your “why”
