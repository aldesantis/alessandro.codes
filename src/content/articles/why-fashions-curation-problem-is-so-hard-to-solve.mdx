## Summary

Retailers struggle with curating personalized shopping experiences for customers online, but startups like Psykhe are using AI to recommend products based on individual tastes. Implementing algorithmic personalization in fashion is challenging due to the physical nature of clothing inventory compared to digital content like music. Companies like Lyst are leveraging data and AI models to enhance personalization and improve conversion rates in online fashion retail.

## Highlights

- Part of what makes some retailers successful isn’t just that they let shoppers easily find what they want but they also provide an educated opinion and a point of view. Otherwise you can wind up another nondescript outlet.
- Retailers also need to be mindful of how rigid their algorithms are. Psykhe’s Maldonado noted that surprise and novelty are important parts of shopping. If an algorithm is optimised strictly for conversion, its recommendations can be as stultifying and uninteresting as ones that aren’t relevant at all.
