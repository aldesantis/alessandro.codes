## Summary

ESSX, a boutique in New York, offers a unique retail experience with a focus on local talent and unisex fashion. Specialty stores like ESSX are thriving by providing personalized service and showcasing emerging brands not easily found online. These boutique retailers are redefining luxury retail by prioritizing community connections and creative in-store experiences over massive online assortments.

## Highlights
- “The decline in the large department stores has in part been replaced by specialty stores,” said Julie Gilhart, a business consultant and former long-time fashion director at Barneys. “Right now, there is a space for good curation, good customer service, interesting activations, playfulness, humour, thinking outside the box … and the hardest thing to create, intimacy.”
