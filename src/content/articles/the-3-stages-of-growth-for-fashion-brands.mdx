## Summary

But first, I want to thank this week's sponsor: Inventory Planner by Sage. If you're still doing planning in a spreadsheet, you're leaving money on the table.

## Highlights
- If you want to become an “everything for everyone” store, you need three things: physical ubiquity/2-day shipping, low prices, and an assortment that spans multiple use cases.

  Basically, an “everything store” has to save people time and money to be worthwhile. Your store has to consolidate multiple shopping outings and do it cheaper. Sephora, Amazon and SHEIN are successful “everything stores”.
