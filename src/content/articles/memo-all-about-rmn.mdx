## Summary

First-party data is defining this era of advertising and sales. Companies are now in a race against time: they’ll build, acquire, or market to the platforms that have it.

## Highlights
- DTC companies were built with the hope of growing independently of America’s largest retail marketplaces but retail media networks like Amazon’s, Target’s, and Walmart’s have already begun to contribute to many of these same brands setting aside idealism for growth.

- Brands may or may not remain (exclusively) direct-to-consumer as the market continues to evolve away from that decade-long strategy but the advertising data used by these brands will be direct-*from*-consumer.
