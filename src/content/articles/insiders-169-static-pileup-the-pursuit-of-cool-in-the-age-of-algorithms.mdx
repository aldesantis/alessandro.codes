## Summary

In the age of algorithms, defining 'cool' has become subjective and specific to different niches, challenging brands that once relied on mainstream appeal. Tastemakers play a crucial role in curating and filtering knowledge to break free from algorithmic constraints and maintain authenticity in a saturated market. Brands must balance niche authenticity with mainstream appeal to sustain long-term success and relevance in a constantly evolving cultural landscape.

## Highlights
- In the age of the algorithm, ‘cool’ has become entirely relative. While in the past, to be ‘cool’ was once synonymous with mainstream popularity, the current flattening of taste hierarchies we experience means that ‘cool’ is an amorphous concept, challenging to define, and specific to the niche you’re in.
- The role of tastemakers today is not to dictate but to act as trusted friends within their niche—helping to sift through the barrage of information, offering paths to freedom and autonomy in the face of the algorithm. It’s pull, not push.

- In the light of algorithmic glut, the function of tastemakers in filtering and recontextualizing takes on renewed importance.
- Brands must carefully balance accessibility with exclusivity, maintaining their relevance within their core community while also appealing to a broader audience. This delicate balancing act requires a deep understanding of the brand's identity, its audience, and the cultural landscape in which it operates.
