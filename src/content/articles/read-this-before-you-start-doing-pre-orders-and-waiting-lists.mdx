## Summary

Pre-orders and waiting lists can boost revenue and manage demand, but they require careful planning to avoid logistical issues. These strategies help brands capture early commitment and gauge interest, but many face challenges with system integration and customer follow-through. Brands should assess their operational setup before implementing these strategies to ensure a smooth process and optimized inventory management.

## Highlights

- At their core, pre-orders and waiting lists address three key challenges. First, they help manage demand and supply imbalances. If your stock is limited or arriving in staggered batches, pre-orders ensure you’re purchasing only what customers truly want, avoiding overstocking or underestimating demand. Second, they mitigate risk by capturing funds or commitments before stock arrives, reducing the financial burden of unsold inventory. Lastly, they streamline stock allocation. Certain off-the-shelf tools allow pre-order systems to dynamically assign incoming stock to customers, keeping processes efficient.
- Pre-orders and waiting lists are not just customer-facing strategies; they’re tools for optimising stock efficiency. Pre-orders act as a live forecast, letting you order just enough stock to meet customer needs without overcommitting.
