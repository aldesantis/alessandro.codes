## Summary

Grief breaks your sense of time, stretching moments into forever and then rushing weeks away. Practical death tasks force you through a hurried, humiliating checklist while you are still falling apart. Afterward the clock keeps ticking but life feels stuck in that one shattered moment.

## Highlights

- Before loss, time is a constant. Reliable. Linear. It passes at the same rate whether you’re bored or ecstatic, whether you’re stuck in traffic or falling in love. But grief time? Grief time is a different physics entirely. It’s elastic and cruel and it obeys no laws you recognise. It will trap you in a single moment for an eternity, then steal weeks from you in what feels like a blink. It will make you desperate to move forward and simultaneously terrified of leaving the last moment when they were still alive.
- Time has become viscous, cement-thick, and you’re wading through it trying to reach the other side of this sentence, this moment, this rupture in the world.
- And then you don’t want the day to end. You can’t sleep, won’t sleep. Because sleeping means waking up tomorrow and tomorrow is the first sunrise without them.
- How can you feel? Process? Mourn? When each day is the next step in this paint-by-numbers process of death? This is the violence they don’t tell you about - not the loss itself, but the inhumane, undignified rush of it all. The way the system treats grief like an administrative inconvenience to be processed and filed and moved along. The way time becomes your enemy twice: first too slow, then too fast, never the rhythm you need.
- And then what? When it’s done. When the giant loo-roll- like cylinder of ashes is delivered, when the paper pushers retreat, when the conveyor belt spits you out the other end. Time will fuck with me once again, I know this. I’ll be left to the mercy of this broken clock that obeys no logic I can follow. To chasms and whiplash and seasons that arrive without them in it. To all the firsts that aren’t firsts - the first birthday, the first Christmas, the first spring - because nothing is first anymore. Everything is after.
- The clock keeps ticking but the hands have fallen off and I’m left here in this strange new country where time moves but doesn’t pass, where days happen but don’t count, where the calendar marches forward but I’m still standing in that moment when the floor opened up and I started to fall.
