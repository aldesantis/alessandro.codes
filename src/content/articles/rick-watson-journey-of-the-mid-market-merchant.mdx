## Highlights
- The “mid-market” is defined in many ways; the simplest and perhaps least sophisticated is based on the business's gross merchandise value (GMV). RMW Commerce has found that most modern industry observers view the range between $10 million and $250 million as the “mid-market.”
- Mid-market merchants have almost all the requirements and complexity of an enterprise business with no margin dollars to pay for it.
- Other Magento and Salesforce agencies interviewed by RMW Commerce are shifting to other players like commercetools, and more broadly headless, in addition to companies like Shopware, to make up for the deficit left by Salesforce and Magento.

- In our experience, the primary reasons for replatform failures include loss of organic traffic, lack of flexibility, integration issues, and failure to uncover hidden build and maintenance costs.
- The needs and challenges of the mid-market merchant are different from both SMB and Enterprise. Whereas Enterprise is incredibly focused on scale and experience, and SMB is focused on proving the business, the mid-market is focused more on going from here to there.
