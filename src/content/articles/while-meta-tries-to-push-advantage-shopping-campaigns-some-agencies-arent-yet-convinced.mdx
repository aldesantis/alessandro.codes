## Summary

Meta’s Performance Marketing Summit was all about its AI Powered Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns. However, gaps within ASC remain.

## Highlights

- ASC lacks cost control features, which means an advertiser doesn’t have control over the efficiency of the campaign, and they can’t set a cost per action target or loss.

- Additionally, some marketers report that ASC is unable to drive significant impact for smaller brands, partially because its AI starts serving ads to a broad user demographic once brands ramp up spending on it.
