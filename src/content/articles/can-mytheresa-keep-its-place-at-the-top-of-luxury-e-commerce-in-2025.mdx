## Summary

Mytheresa is working to maintain its top position in luxury e-commerce by focusing on its high-spending customers and planning to acquire competitor Yoox-Net-a-Porter. The company aims to innovate and adapt to market changes while providing a unique shopping experience online. To succeed, it must balance retaining loyal customers with attracting new ones, all while managing costs effectively.

## Highlights

- It is possible to create a luxurious experience online, but it’s not a copycat of what the store can do.
  What we can do is understand what the customer wants from us, and the customer wants inspiration.
  I have a great quote from a customer. She said, ‘I don’t have the luxury to waste time.’ Once the purchase has been decided, once the inspiration has succeeded, our luxury is it’s efficient, it’s fast. Our luxury is you don’t have to worry, you don’t have to drive to town.
  You have to define luxury in the way the customer wants it.
- We know that the satisfaction score on the first purchase was a big driver for loyalty, because if you don’t have a good satisfaction, you don’t get a chance for the second time.
- We need to ensure that there’s more than just price. We cannot take the price away. We cannot say, ‘No, you have to ignore price;’ it’s impossible.
  You need to overcome this by providing excellent service. Yes, you can get it there at 10 percent, but we have the full trust. If something happens, we are [here] for you. Are you sure the other shop will do that for you? Are you sure it’s the right product? You need to compensate for it.
  Our strategy is not: they have minus-10, then we have also minus-10. That just doesn’t make sense economically. So what additional emotional components can we do?
