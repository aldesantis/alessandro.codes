## Summary

The internet is changing due to the rise of AI, threatening the traditional roles of writers and publishers. AI-generated content and large language models (LLMs) may disrupt the connection between creators and audiences. To preserve the web as a valuable resource, it is crucial for platforms to prioritize human creativity and knowledge production over AI optimization.

## Highlights
- Eventually, people may stop writing, stop filming, stop composing—at least for the open, public web. People will still create, but for small, select audiences, walled off from the content-hoovering AIs. The great public commons of the web will be gone.
