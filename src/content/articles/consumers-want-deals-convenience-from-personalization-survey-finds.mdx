## Summary

Most consumers prefer personalized experiences from brands, with many comfortable using public information for this purpose. Personalized interactions can help customers find better prices and make their shopping easier. While human touches can build loyalty, some companies may benefit more from automated personalization methods.

## Highlights
- A majority of customers want brands to personalize their interactions. About 4 in 5 global consumers, and three-quarters of U.S. consumers, are comfortable with personalization using publicly available information, according to a Boston Consulting Group survey [released earlier this month](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/what-consumers-want-from-personalization).
- Among U.S. consumers, the most common benefits of personalized experiences are finding the best price, making the experience more enjoyable and making the experience faster or easier, according to the survey of 23,000 global consumers.
- More than one-quarter of baby boomer respondents say they are very uncomfortable with companies using public information to personalize experiences. Less than 1 in 10 Gen Z respondents say the same.
