## Summary

Students often believe their grades should reflect their effort, but high marks should be based on excellence, not just hard work. Celebrating effort is important, but it can lead to a misunderstanding that effort alone guarantees success. Instead of focusing solely on trying harder, students should learn to work smarter and understand that mastery of material is what truly counts.

## Highlights
- The problem is that we’ve taken the practice of celebrating industriousness too far. We’ve gone from commending effort to [treating it as an end in itself](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-85298-001). We’ve taught a generation of kids that their worth is defined primarily by their work ethic. We’ve failed to remind them that working hard doesn’t guarantee doing a good job (let alone being a good person). And that does students a disservice.
- There’s a reason we award Olympic medals to the athletes who swim the fastest, not the ones who train the hardest. What counts is not sheer effort but the progress and performance that result. Motivation is only one of multiple variables in the achievement equation. Ability, opportunity and luck count, too. Yes, you can get better at anything, but you can’t be great at everything.
