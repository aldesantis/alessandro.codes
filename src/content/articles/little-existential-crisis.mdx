## Summary

The author shared the results of an “Ask Me Anything” session with subscribers, expressing gratitude for their support. They discussed learning from past experiences, admired writers, and offered advice on navigating existential crises. The author emphasized finding compassion, setting boundaries, and following paths that bring a sense of ease and expansion in decision-making.

## Highlights

- Lean into complexity. Be skeptical of anyone who tells you that there are right, just people and wrong, evil ones. Life just doesn’t work that way, unfortunately. Look for nuance, always. The real work is finding compassion for people you disagree with.
- Your body’s so-called limitations are like little clues leading you to a better place. I’ve learned that finding ways to accommodate them, rather than steamrolling or ignoring them, makes my life much better.
