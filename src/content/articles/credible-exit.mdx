## Summary

Elon Musk may be buying Twitter, raising concerns about centralized control. "Credible exit" allows users to leave platforms easily, seen in examples like DNS and email. Offering protocols for data export and open-source apps can enhance user autonomy and credible exit.

## Highlights
- Side note: DNS is the unsung hero of web1. A mapping between network layer (domain name) and physical layer (IP), controlled fully by users, enabling them to keep centralized services in check with a credible ability to exit.
