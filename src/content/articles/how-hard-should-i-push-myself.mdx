## Summary

What the science of stress tells us about peak performance

## Highlights
- stress isn’t mathematical. Expose the same person to the same stressor, and they will have different stress responses based on their coping strategies.
- When you’re facing mild to moderate stressors, ask yourself, *How can I increase my sense of control in this situation?* You might find there are simple answers that will make you feel a lot better.

- Creating a vibrant sense of social support can put an unmanageable stressor into perspective and help keep it under control. Without social support, even small things can set us off in ways that are unproductive and unhealthy.
