## Summary

It’s easier to measure and feel high autonomy than it is to measure high alignment. But without alignment, autonomy is squandered.

## Highlights

- The hardest part of building a company is alignment on strategy and clearly communicating it. Think about it this way, a 1 degree deviation in course of a rocket heading to the sun means it will miss the sun by 1.2 million miles. A lack of alignment compounds quickly.

- And here’s the hard part…the second you leave an alignment meeting, you’re mis-aligned again. That’s fine, it’s normal.
  Alignment decays incredibly quickly.
