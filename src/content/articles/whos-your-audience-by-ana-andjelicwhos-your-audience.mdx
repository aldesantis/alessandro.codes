- _Observers_: A brand reaches observers when it does something that the wider culture pays attention to. Observers are usually reached when a mass brand does a collaboration
- _Fans._ Fans connect with a brand on a social level. They identify with a brand’s values, appreciate its aesthetics, enjoy its tone of voice and/or seek to be part of its community. Fans may strive to, or occasionally buy a brand’s products, but the products aren’t the basis of the connection.

- _Commentators_. Commentators have the most impartial relationship to a brand, and are most likely interested in it if a brand does something interesting per cultural Observers and Collaborators. Commentators also take interest in the brand if it pushes the boundaries of its category, market or the business model.
