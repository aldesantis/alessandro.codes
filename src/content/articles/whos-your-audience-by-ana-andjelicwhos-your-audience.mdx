## Summary

And are you taking all of them into consideration?

## Highlights
- at any given time, a brand has a much wider and more complex audience of cultural observers, fans, customers, commentators and collaborators.

- *Observers*: A brand reaches observers when it does something that the wider culture pays attention to. Observers are usually reached when a mass brand does a collaboration
- *Fans.* Fans connect with a brand on a social level. They identify with a brand’s values, appreciate its aesthetics, enjoy its tone of voice and/or seek to be part of its community. Fans may strive to, or occasionally buy a brand’s products, but the products aren’t the basis of the connection.

- *Commentators*. Commentators have the most impartial relationship to a brand, and are most likely interested in it if a brand does something interesting per cultural Observers and Collaborators. Commentators also take interest in the brand if it pushes the boundaries of its category, market or the business model.
