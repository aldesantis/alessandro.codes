## Summary

Language models can transform any question into a detailed answer, acting like a personal encyclopedia that expands on ideas. They help users explore creative possibilities by generating new content, such as metaphors or entire stories, based on simple prompts. This ability to expand text makes it easier for people to find inspiration and develop their thoughts creatively.

## Highlights
- Creative expansions are the truly generative part of generative AI. They make it easy to traverse a space of possibilities.
- It’s easier for humans to edit than it is to generate, and we don’t always have the energy to filter through all of the possibilities we might want to in order to find the precise word, the brightest idea, or the best plot twist. Creative expansions help us map the possibility space so we can bring the best of what we find back to our work.
