## Summary

Far from replacing the personal, face-to-face service at the heart of the luxury shopping experience, new technologies and digital channels are giving brands engaging and creative ways to enhance their customer relationships.

## Highlights

- Browns associates use an app that provides the usual clienteling features as well as what Deveaux called a “connected retail layer.” This layer allows associates to, for example, scan a QR code in the consumer-facing Browns app to connect to a shopper’s account on the store’s site.
- Chanel fitting rooms have RFID sensors that read tags on the items customers are trying on, allowing a connected mirror to show information such as videos and photos of items as they appeared on the runway.
- wholesale distribution today is very much seen as a marketing function, because brands have the opportunity to go direct to consumers.
