## Summary

Traditional fairytale structure fits naturally in our brains, and thus can guide strategic problem-analysis, and a plan that everyone understands.

## Highlights

- **Our brains are pre-wired for fairy-tales**, so we naturally follow the presentation as it flows into those primordial ruts in our gray matter.

- When you don’t articulate what we’re _not_ doing, it makes it appear that you don’t know those things exist. Perception is reality. Stakeholders or even people on the team believe you’re ignoring important things, when in fact you’ve _selected_ some things instead, and for a specific reason. You need to say that out loud.
