## Summary

Solo Brands, known for Solo Stove and other outdoor brands, invested heavily in brand marketing during the fourth quarter but did not see the expected sales lift, leading to a debate about the effectiveness of their campaigns. The company’s new CEO mentioned the importance of balancing brand and performance marketing, highlighting the need to convert during key sales seasons. This situation reflects a common challenge for startups in finding the right balance between brand and performance marketing to ensure long-term success and growth. The company’s decision to end its marketing contract and focus on full-funnel marketing showcases the evolving landscape where brands must strategically invest in both types of marketing to thrive.

## Highlights

- Baines from Inkbox said that when brands plan an “above the line” campaign — which he defines as brand marketing that speaks to major cultural moments — they should be planning at least six months to a year out.
- Another big challenge that brands run into when making the jump from performance to brand marketing is that they don’t know how to correctly judge the success of a brand marketing campaign. Brand marketing is about driving both awareness and perception. Looking at things like an increase in website traffic or social media visits before and after a brand marketing campaign is the first, most basic way to measure its effectiveness.
