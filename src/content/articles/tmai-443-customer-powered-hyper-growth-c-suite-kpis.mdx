## Summary

The article emphasizes the importance of focusing on existing customers for driving business growth instead of solely chasing new ones. It introduces four key performance indicators (KPIs) — Net Revenue Retention, New Referred Customers, Earned Growth Ratio, and Customer Lifetime Value — that help measure and enhance customer relationships. These metrics provide a broader view of company success and guide strategic decisions for sustainable hyper-growth.

## Highlights

- Unfortunately, self-reported scores and misinterpretations of the NPS framework have sown confusion and diminished its credibility.
  Inexperienced practitioners abused it by doing things like linking Net Promoter Scores to bonuses for frontline employees, which made them care more about their scores than about learning to better serve customers.
  Many firms amplify the problem by publicly reporting their scores to investors with no explanation of the process used to generate them and no safeguards to prevent pleading (“I’ll lose my job if you don’t rate me a 10”), bribery (“We’ll give you free oil changes for a 10”), and manipulation (“We never send surveys to customers whose claim was denied”).
  No details are provided about which customers (and how many) were surveyed, their response rates, or whether the survey was triggered by a specific transaction.
  Reports rarely mention whether the research was performed by a reliable third-party expert using double-blind methodology. In other words, some firms have turned Net Promoter Scores into vanity statistics that damage the credibility of NPS.
