## Summary

Strengths and weaknesses are often two sides of the same trait. For example, an engineer’s speed can lead to quick results but may also cause them to miss important details. It’s essential to help team members recognize this duality so they can adjust their strengths based on the situation.

## Highlights

- **The qualities we celebrate in our team members are usually the same ones causing our biggest headaches**. They’re not separate traits; they’re two sides of the same coin.
- I don’t think our job is to sand down people’s edges until everyone’s the same boring shape. We’re not trying to “fix” our engineers. Instead, we’re helping them see themselves clearly, warts and all, and teaching them when to crank up or dial back their natural tendencies.
