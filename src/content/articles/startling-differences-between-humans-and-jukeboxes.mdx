## Summary

Humans are often motivated by rewards like money and prestige, leading to behavior driven by incentives. However, the theory of intrinsic motivation suggests that people also care about other factors beyond external rewards. The key to influencing behavior lies in understanding and aligning with individuals’ internal motivations.

## Highlights

- When you rejigger incentives in the hopes of changing behavior, you attract the people who are most motivated by the incentives themselves, and these are the people you want to attract the _least_.
- The best way to use incentives, then, is to:
  1) find the people who already want what you want
  2) help them survive
- Anybody who’s like, “I hate lying to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but those are the incentives in finance!” or “I hate writing crappy papers, but those are the incentives in academia!” or “I hate making hamburgers that are mostly sawdust, but those are the incentives in the restaurant industry!”—they’re admitting that they’re only going to do the right thing when it’s convenient. I want to find the people who are willing to do the right thing even when it’s _inconvenient_, and hand them some money so they can keep doing that.
