## Summary

In the digital age, artists often struggle to find intrinsic value in their work as it becomes reduced to market metrics and external validation. This shift leads to a loss of self-worth, as creators must constantly measure their success against social media popularity and sales figures. Ultimately, the personal and artistic essence of their creations is overshadowed by the demands of the market.

## Highlights

- But the most essential quality that makes a job a job is that when we are at work, we surrender the power to decide the worth of what we do.
- It’s painful to have your sense of worth extracted. For Marx, the poet of economics, when a person’s innate value is replaced with exchange value, it is as if we’ve been reduced to “a mere jelly.”
- My scale of worth had torn off, like a roof in a hurricane, replaced with an external one. An external scale is a relative scale; so of course, nothing’s enough. There is no top.
- Clocking out is obsolete when, in the deep quiet of our minds, we lack the pay grade to determine worth.
- We are not giving away our value, as a puritanical grandparent might scold; we are giving away our facility _to_ value. We’ve been cored like apples, a dependency created, hooked on the public internet to tell us the worth.
- Shein’s model is dystopic: countless reports detail how it puts its workers in obscene poverty in order to sell a reprieve to consumers who are also moneyless—a saturated plush world lasting as long as the seams in one of their dresses. Yet the day to day of Shein’s target shopper is so bleak, we strain our moral character to cosplay a life of plenty.
