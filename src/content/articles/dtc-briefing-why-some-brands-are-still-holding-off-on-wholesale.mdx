## Summary

Some brands in the direct-to-consumer (DTC) space are choosing to remain wholesale holdouts, sticking to their DTC-only business model. One example is beauty brand Prose, which relies on its data-driven model and personalized products to maintain its DTC strategy. Another example is cleaning brand Branch Basics, which has focused on customer acquisition and retention to stay profitable without entering retail. These brands have found success in their respective categories and have chosen to wait before expanding into wholesale, citing the risks and challenges associated with retail distribution.

## Highlights

- Retail distribution, while an investment in growing the brand’s physical presence, isn’t cheap. Not only do small businesses have to burn cash to fulfill big orders upfront, chain retailers also expect them to promote themselves and drive customers to its shelves.
