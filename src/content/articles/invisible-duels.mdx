## Summary

Invisible duels are unspoken competitions that arise when we compare ourselves to others in personal or professional settings, often fueled by social media. These duels can create anxiety and distract us from our true goals, as we become fixated on someone else’s progress instead of our own. To break free from these traps, we must focus on our values and stop letting external comparisons dictate our self-worth.

## Highlights

- It’s far easier said than done, but clarity, focus, and an authentic sense of direction are the rare things that will give you peace and conviction to go your own way—regardless of the noise around you.
