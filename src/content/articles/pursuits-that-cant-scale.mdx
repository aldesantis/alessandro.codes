## Summary

The article discusses the idea of balancing pursuits that can scale with those that can’t scale, emphasizing the importance of finding fulfillment in non-scalable activities. It highlights how successful individuals often gravitate towards pursuits like hobbies or small businesses that have a clear ceiling, providing a sense of grounding and fulfillment. Ultimately, the text encourages readers to consider the value of pursuing things that may not have massive scale but offer personal satisfaction and balance.

## Highlights

- I can’t help but notice though that after a successful stint at building things that do scale (or at least giving it a really good, long try), many people seem to gravitate towards building things that don’t scale.
  I have a theory that _chasing things that scale_ makes you need therapy, and the therapy is _pursuing things that can’t scale_.
- I think another driver of this sentiment and behavior is that chasing scale strips you of some humanity. It puts your head too high up in the clouds. It removes you from what happens in the real world with real people. _Pursuing something that can’t scale does the exact opposite: it grounds you._ It’s a comforting and healing next act.
