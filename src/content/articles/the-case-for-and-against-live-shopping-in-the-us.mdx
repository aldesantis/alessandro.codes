## Summary

Live shopping in the U.S. is growing but faces challenges, including skepticism and high costs. While some brands see success on platforms like TikTok Shop, the future of TikTok is uncertain due to potential legal issues. Brands need to commit significant resources and time to succeed in live shopping, making it a risky investment.

## Highlights
- Live shopping sales could account for more than [5% of total e-commerce](https://www.emarketer.com/content/what-brands-need-know-about-livestream-ecommerce) in the U.S. by 2026, per Coresight Research.
- “Lives will be the future because it is the most engaging way to have a conversation with the customer and explain to them every question they have and every reason why they should go make that purchase,” Leogrande said.
