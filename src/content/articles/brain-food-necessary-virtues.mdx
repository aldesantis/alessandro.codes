## Summary

â€œThe most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already.

## Highlights
- The highest form of leverage is reputation.
- Reasoning in public forces discipline of thought.
  It's like doing math on the chalkboard in front of the class. Every step must be clear and correct, or someone will point out the mistake. There's no room for fuzzy thinking or skipped steps.
  If your reasoning is correct, you have nothing to fear. If it's wrong, you have everything to learn.
