Content is king, but distribution is the kingdom

## Summary

Brands are increasingly outsourcing content creation, which limits their ability to connect authentically with consumers. To succeed in today’s market, brands need to adopt a "publish model," acting like media companies by creating and distributing their own content. This shift will help them build direct connections with their audience and foster a unique brand identity.

## Highlights
- To keep a consumers attention, brands need to offer a supra-attuned point of view, one that can translate numerous inputs—pop culture references, micro-trends, identity aspirations—and form a coherent narrative that puts forward a lifestyle and belief system that they can, quite literally, subscribe to.
- Today’s customer-as-audience wants a direct connection with a brand, curated from the inside, with a discernable personality and point of view.
