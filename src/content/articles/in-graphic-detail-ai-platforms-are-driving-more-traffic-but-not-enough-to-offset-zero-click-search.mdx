## Summary

AI platforms like ChatGPT are sending more traffic to news sites, but not enough to balance out fewer clicks from Google’s AI Overviews. These AI Overviews appear in about 20% of searches and cause more “zero-click” results, reducing visits to publishers. Meanwhile, over one-third of Americans now use generative AI tools, making this technology a major part of how people search and find information.

## Highlights

- The percentage of Google search queries that show an AI Overview has steadily increased this year. But that number plateaued in May to about 20% of U.S. desktop searches, according to Semrush data shared with Digiday.
- Since the U.S. launch of Google’s AI Overviews in May 2024, the number of searches for news that result in no click-throughs to news websites has grown from 56% to nearly 69% by May 2025, according to Similarweb data.
