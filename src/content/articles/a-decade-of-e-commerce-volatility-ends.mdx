## Summary

Widespread predictions of disrupted U.S. holiday sales due to escalating tariffs proved unfounded. According to Adobe Analytics, online spending on Cyber Monday hit $14.25 billion, up 7.1% year over year, while Black Friday reached $11.8 billion, up 9.1%.

## Highlights

- From 2022 through 2025, annual growth has consistently tracked between 5-10%, a dramatic deceleration from the 15-20%+ rates that defined 2017-2020 but a sustainable pattern that persisted through inflation, tariff escalation, and continued supply chain adjustments. The 2025 holiday season confirms this represents structural maturity, not a temporary plateau.
- E-commerce has reached equilibrium. Barring another global shutdown, 5-8% annual growth represents the new normal: sustainable expansion driven by incremental mobile adoption and gradual retail channel shift rather than structural transformation.
