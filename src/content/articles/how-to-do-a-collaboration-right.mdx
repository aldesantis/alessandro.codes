- Within this strategic decision-making framework, choose one or both of the below approaches for your brand collaboration:
  • Choose a partner that will creatively reinterpret your signature products, either through their own internal team or through external creators, artists, designers, curators, stylists, etc. Example: Tiffany&Co.
  • License your brand signifiers (logo, brand codes, color palette, signature prints) to other brands. Example: Supreme
- The final part of collaborations strategy is to make it part of the production, distribution, marketing and sales rollout plan. Build a production and distribution timeline. Connect it with your entire product line and marketing activations. Think holistically and in terms of a halo effect that a collaboration will have on your entire brand. Tie a collaboration to a collection and campaign rollout, and use it to build interest in your own’s brand products. Release a collaboration beforehand to garner PR and press and then bring it home through your own collection.
