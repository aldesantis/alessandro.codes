## Summary

Brand marketing has undergone a fundamental change and requires a new operating system to capture attention and budgets. The new system is based on a brand’s renewal and cultural relevance. To make commodities aspirational, brand marketing gives them symbolic value, transforming ordinary consumption into cultural participation. The new approach focuses on creating, amplifying, and monetizing cultural moments through collaborations, visual language, pop-ups, content, storytelling, and more. This holistic approach protects pricing power, ensures high margins, and expands a brand’s footprint. The new brand marketing strategy is about cultural awareness, emotional resonance, entertainment, and market expansion, creating a consistent and entertaining brand world that people aspire to be part of.

## Highlights

- The main purpose of brand marketing is to make commodities aspirational, turning their use value into exchange value (social, cultural, and environmental capital).
- Brand marketing gives symbolic value to ordinary consumption.
- By connecting all its creative executions, across functions, brand marketing creates a self-enforcing loop of cultural influence.
- The new brand marketing is less about communicating (just) the brand identity and values and more about activating this identity and values as a consistent, encompassing, and entertaining brand world that people aspire to be part of and identify with.
- New brand marketing protects pricing power, ensures high margins and reframes consumers’ perception of the company and its products.

- The new brand marketing is a strategy of cultural awareness, emotional resonance, entertainment, celebrity products, fandom-building, and market expansion. This strategy is easier to understand once it’s taken out of the context of marketing and put into the domain of cultural influence.
