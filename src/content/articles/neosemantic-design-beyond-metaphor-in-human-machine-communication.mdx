## Summary

Humans are creating machines that think and feel in new ways beyond our usual understanding. We need new ways to communicate with these machines that go beyond simple symbols and metaphors. This new design, called neosemantics, aims to create shared meaning between humans and machines through feelings, rhythms, and experiences.

## Highlights

- machines develop their own cognitive landscapes, the GUI becomes a limiting frameâ€”a beautiful map of a world that no longer exists.
