## Summary

The text discusses how Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can help individuals find meaning and productivity in their lives by developing psychological flexibility. ACT focuses on moving towards what we value in life by addressing avoidance behaviors and learning to engage with challenging thoughts and feelings. By practicing the core skills of ACT, individuals can make small behavioral shifts that align with their values and lead to positive changes in their lives.

## Highlights

- When we’re focused on avoiding difficult thoughts and feelings, we’re not focused on moving toward what we care about.
- When we’re caught in avoidance, we tend to see our thoughts as “true.” ACT calls this process “fusion.” When we are fused, we react to a thought as if it were an external reality, as opposed to a cognitive and physiological experience happening inside of our mind and body.

- Defusion is about seeing thoughts as real, but not necessarily true, and about choosing to give weight to the thoughts that help us move toward the lives we want to live.

- The body lives in the present, so when you’re noticing a lot of past- or future-oriented thinking, coming back to your various senses is a powerful way to return to the here and now.
- Moving toward a flexible sense of self and others is about recognizing that any story we tell, good or bad, is not the whole truth about a person, and is only true within a given context.

- When working with committed action, there are no “right” or “wrong” behaviors, and no step is too small—anything done in service of your values is a step toward building a life that matters to you. Living fully is the ultimate goal, and looks different for each and every person.
