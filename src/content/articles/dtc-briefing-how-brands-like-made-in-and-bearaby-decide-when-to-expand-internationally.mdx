## Summary

Many direct-to-consumer startups are expanding internationally before the holiday season. Brands like Made In and Bearaby are launching e-commerce sites in countries like the U.K. and Germany. This move aims to attract more customers in North America and Europe.

## Highlights

- There are a few different approaches startups can take when it comes to international expansion. Some brands opt to test the waters first with a cross-border e-commerce solution and gather data on the best-performing markets before they launch their own international sites. Others opt to first make their way into an international market with a trusted partner, like a wholesaler.
