## Summary

BuzzFeed sold its Complex division to NTWRK for $108.6 million in cash, plus $5.7 million for office space and severance costs. This move marks a shift for BuzzFeed, retaining First We Feast while operating independently from Complex. The sale will bring NTWRK and Complex together under new ownership, aiming to create a more resilient business model. The deal will result in two distinct companies, one focusing on news and pop culture at BuzzFeed, and the other on fashion, sneakers, and streetwear at Complex.

## Highlights

- I think as time has gone on, there’s been a lot of publishers who aspire to get into shopping, or a lot of commerce platforms and aspire to get into media storytelling to drive more commerce,” Levant added. “And really, instead of trying to build a new core competency, it’s really about bringing two organizations together that have those key core competencies and speak to the same consumer by bringing all of the passions or interests for both editorial and kind of together on one platform.”
