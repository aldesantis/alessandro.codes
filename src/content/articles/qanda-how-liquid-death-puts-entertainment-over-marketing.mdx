## Summary

‘We’re closer to a writer’s room than a traditional marketing department’

## Highlights

- We simply put entertainment over marketing. We hate corporate marketing as much as anyone else, so our goal is just to make something that’s going to be the best thing someone sees in their feed that day.
- Advertising is just day-trading attention. We want to put stuff out in the world that people genuinely love and that they connect with**. If you laugh along with someone, that’s such a more authentic, real connection.**
