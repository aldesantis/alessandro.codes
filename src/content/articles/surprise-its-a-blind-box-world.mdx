## Summary

People crave surprise because modern life feels too predictable and boring. Blind-box toys and unexpected moments break this routine and spark excitement. In a world shaped by patterns and algorithms, surprise is key to keeping us engaged and curious.

## Highlights

- Every generation’s purpose is to make the environment easier and more abundant for the next. But is there a point where we go so far in rounding the corners that we’re starved for purpose and stuffed with boredom?
- We’ve conditioned ourselves to abide by systems of predictable lifestyles and social dynamics — best practices — because humans are wired to protect themselves from threats. That means reducing unexpected outcomes and mitigating risk. But we’re leaving ourselves a world without wonder, where curiosity is choked, and pure creativity is throttled. Fashion becomes formulaic and streaming music becomes algorithmic.
- We’ve cultivated such refined patterns that we’ve become masterful predictors of what’s next. It makes us feel safe and satiated, but it also makes us indifferent and uninspired. This is why Trump continues to control the discourse. We never know what he’ll say, which tariffs he’ll enact, or who he’ll pardon.
- Pokemon cards and sports cards have been “blind-boxing” for generations now. But the surprise has hit a fever pitch in cards because traditional collecting has gotten so formulaic, convenient, and mundane. With sneakers and streetwear (two collectors’ pastimes that have lost their froth), what you see is what you get. The process is catalyzed by hype and low supply, but it’s rhythmic and follows a ritualistic cadence. Imagine how the hobby would transform if sneaker collecting carried a rogue Trump moment. What if 1 out of 72 customers open the Undefeated Jordan IV box to discover [an original pair](https://www.complex.com/sneakers/a/ben-felderstein/undefeated-air-jordan-4-2025-2005-comparison) from 2005, worth $40,000 at resale?
