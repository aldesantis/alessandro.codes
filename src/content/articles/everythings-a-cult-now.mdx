## Summary

The text discusses how the internet has led to a fragmented society resembling a collection of cults. It explores how modern cults form around critiques of the mainstream and how the erosion of a shared reality can impact democracy. The author reflects on the historical shift from a monoculture to a diverse media landscape, highlighting the benefits and challenges it presents.

## Highlights

- when the Bastille fell in 1789, a Canton 30 minutes away from Paris didn’t realize the French Revolution had happened for a full month. That was the speed at which information used to travel. It was the speed at which a man could ride a horse or walk next to his horse.
- I never liked the phrase “post-truth” because it implied there was a golden age in which we lived _in_ truth. That’s bullshit.
