## Summary

Brands are increasingly using collaborations across various cultural fields like food, art, and hospitality to create immersive experiences and build a recognizable identity. This strategy allows them to engage consumers in new ways and diversify their revenue streams. Ultimately, these collaborations help brands establish themselves as cultural tastemakers and foster loyalty among fans.

## Highlights

- The ultimate branding is of our time and how we pass it, so brands use collaborations to curate what we eat, how we travel, the art and culture we have access to, the entertainment we enjoy, in addition to what we wear.
- If fashion has a waning cultural influence (and market power), brands can move into areas that consumers find aspirational and spend money on (food, hospitality, wellness, art, furnitureâ€¦) and keep building their cultural, social and economic capital there in order to ensure their longevity.
    - Note: What does it mean mean for multi brand retailers?
