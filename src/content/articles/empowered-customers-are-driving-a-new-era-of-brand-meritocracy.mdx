## Summary

AI assistants are changing how products are evaluated based on objective criteria. Brands must adapt to appeal to AI assistants and deliver genuine quality to succeed in this new Brand Meritocracy era. Creating impactful brand experiences will be crucial for success in a world where AI plays a significant role in consumer decision-making.

## Highlights

- AI’s pattern recognition capabilities will likely still favor established brands that have ingrained themselves in consumer habits, effectively recommending a brand because it is the “most likely” answer to the query based on its dataset. However, for new products in emerging categories where brand patterns are not yet established, focusing on the tangible quality and measurable product value that AI assistants evaluate may be more effective than investing heavily in brand awareness. This implies fighting the battle in the lower funnel only, like many [D2C brands do today](https://www.adweek.com/social-marketing/d2c-brand-algorithm-social-tactics/).
