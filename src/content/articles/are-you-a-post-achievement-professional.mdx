## Summary

The concept of a Post-Achievement Professional questions the traditional drive for success and financial independence. Instead of measuring self-worth through achievements, it emphasizes living in alignment with personal values and finding fulfillment beyond external validation. This journey involves recognizing the flaws in the achievement playbook and prioritizing meaningful experiences over constant productivity.

## Highlights

- Han argues that we go from being _obedience subjects_ to _achievement subjects_. We’re no longer workers, we’re “entrepreneurs of ourselves” – commodities (i.e. human capital) that also can be transacted upon using the mechanisms of the free-market. Therefore we give ourselves a “market value” which fluctuates based upon productivity, performance, success and achievement.
- If how you spend your time and money aligns with what you value, by definition _you’re productive._
- The secret to satisfaction is not to increase our haves—that will never work (or at least, it will never last). That is the treadmill formula, not the satisfaction formula. The secret is to manage our wants. By managing what we want instead of what we have, we give ourselves a chance to lead more satisfied lives.
- It’s taken me a while to realize, but the activity that brings me true life satisfaction is **having earnest conversations.** If I do that, do it well, and do it often – I’m doing great.
