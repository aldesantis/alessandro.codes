It’s very weird to have a skull full of poison

## Summary

A tale of ten strangenesses

## Highlights

- She probably already knew what I would only realize later: I wanted to solve my bad feelings the way I had learned to solve everything in life, which is by being a diligent student and a good boy. But you can’t ace feeling good like it’s a math test, and trying only makes you feel worse. My recovery was going to be far more mysterious than I could possibly appreciate.
- I wonder if this is the secret behind a lot of skull-poisons: you secretly think you’re not sick at all, and you believe that what you’re thinking about is actually extremely important. Yes, when other people think “I’m worthless” over and over, they have depression, but when _I_ do it, I’m just contemplating reality, and what could be more important than that?
- An uncomfortable truth: when you feel really bad, it’s easy to become boring and selfish. You get so obsessed with the tempest inside your head that you can’t focus on anything outside of it. You start seeing a therapist, then you start treating all of your conversations like therapy. Your bad feelings become a handy excuse for being a bad friend.
- But after stumbling through ten strangenesses, maybe I’ve finally figured out the mistake I keep making: I expect my life to follow the rules of good narrative. Effects are supposed to have causes. The laws of the universe are supposed to be knowable and consistent. If something keeps coming up, it should be important.
