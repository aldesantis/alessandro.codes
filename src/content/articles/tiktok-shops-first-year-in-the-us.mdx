## Summary

TikTok Shop launched in the U.S. a year ago and has sold billions, but most top sellers are lesser-known brands using unique strategies or going viral. Goli Nutrition is currently the leading brand, with sales exceeding $7 million through aggressive affiliate campaigns, including unusual rewards like cars for top affiliates. While TikTok has made strides in social commerce, it still faces challenges in attracting a wider range of brands and products.
