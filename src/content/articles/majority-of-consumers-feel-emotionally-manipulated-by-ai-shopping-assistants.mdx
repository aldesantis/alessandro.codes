## Summary

A recent survey found that 70% of consumers feel “emotionally manipulated” by AI shopping assistants, which often drive impulse purchases through feelings like guilt and FOMO. About 60% of respondents make frequent impulse buys based on AI suggestions, especially younger consumers who are more susceptible to guilt-driven shopping. Experts warn that while AI can personalize the shopping experience, retailers must avoid exploiting these emotions to maintain consumer trust.

## Highlights

- “AI shopping assistants have unlocked new ways to engage consumers, but this survey highlights the fine line between personalization and manipulation. Retailers need to tread carefully to maintain trust.”
