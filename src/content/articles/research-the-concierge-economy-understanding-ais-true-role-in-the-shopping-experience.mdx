## Summary

AI is changing how people shop by helping them find, compare, and choose products more easily. Many consumers now start their shopping journey using AI, especially during holidays, to save time and money. Brands must adapt to this new “concierge economy” where AI guides discovery but human connection remains important.

## Highlights

- For decades, brick-and-mortar retail’s value proposition has rested on discovery and comparison: the ability to easily look at two items side by side and make an informed decision. AI now performs these functions faster, cheaper, and from the couch. These results don’t invalidate the value of brick-and-mortar itself. If anything, they confirm just how critical other components of the experience are. Unless stores offer something meaningfully different, such as access to community, high-value service, or cultural experiences, they risk losing relevance in the critical top and middle stages of the funnel altogether.
- AI has become consumers’ most practical, personalized tool for discovery, comparison, and confidence-building. It is the **new front door to commerce for high-intent, time-constrained, digitally fluent shoppers**.
- the most notable throughline connecting both data-collection phases is that **this is not where consumers want to complete transactions _(yet)._**
- In Phase 1 of the research, 77% of consumers said that when a generative AI platform makes a product recommendation, they are more likely to click through to a merchant’s website to continue researching or complete the purchase.
- In Phase 1 of the survey, more than 57% of all consumers reported being so tired of hunting for deals that they wanted AI to handle price comparisons on their behalf. Among those who had experience shopping via AI, 60% have used it at least sometimes to find the best price on an item (22% always, 38% sometimes).
- They’ve assigned AI platforms the roles of **curators** and **concierges**. These platforms help curate users’ tastes and visual identities, and also deliver the most relevant brands and products based on users’ **contextual needs and preferences. It’s automated identity formation.**
- Conversely, categories associated with symbolism, identity, and deep brand affinity, such as luxury and sporting goods, exhibited _significantly_ lower AI usage.
- **For those in AI-strong categories, content must answer questions by focusing on structured data, detailed attributes, comparisons, and clear value propositions**.
- In categories where AI is used less frequently, content must create desire through storytelling, worldbuilding, and emotional resonance. It should help contextualize the brands and products through a trend and aesthetic lens.
- AI certainly narrows the pool of options, leading consumers to click through to fewer sites and visit less often. However, it does not eliminate high-intent, highly engaged consumers who are more likely to explore and convert.
- AI threatens physical retail nearly four times more than branded eCommerce.
- **Simultaneously design for machines that curate** **and** **humans who seek meaning**. Provide the rich, accurate, and structured data that engines need to trust and validate your brand and/or product. This includes product specifications, ingredients, product availability, pricing, and aesthetic information. Landing pages for AI traffic should mirror the specificity of the query that produced them.
- **Ensure branded eCommerce sites provide the value that AI can’t.** AI can gather information, research, and surface answers, but it can’t fully convey a brand’s lore or create belonging. That remains the domain of human-centered brand experiences.
- **Continue the concierge experience.** Generative AI platforms are so effective because they provide concierge-level support through contextual conversations. The high-intent shoppers who come from these platforms to your site require the same level of service and experience. Branded chatbots and co-pilots can continue the conversation, asking proactive and thoughtful questions that help shoppers find the product and service they’re seeking.
