## Summary

Don’t ask “what’s our AI strategy?”—instead, set a clear goal like automating 30% of tasks by 2030. Focus on fixing boring, repetitive work between teams, not flashy AI demos or hiring experts. Real progress comes from steady, practical steps that simplify workflows and cut busywork.

## Highlights

- Go look at the places where teams hand over to each other. That’s where data gets copied, double-checked, and re-entered.
  Look between merch and logistics. Between systems that were built for different decades.
  That’s where the opportunity is. Not in a shiny demo. Not in a brainstorm about the future of AI. It’s in the grim, daily stuff that good people hate doing.
