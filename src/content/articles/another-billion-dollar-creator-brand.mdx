## Summary

Hailey Bieber’s beauty brand Rhode sold for $1 billion by using her large Instagram audience instead of relying on Amazon or traditional marketplaces. Creator brands like Rhode focus on building direct relationships with fans to sell products, avoiding high fees from platforms. This new approach challenges old e-commerce models, showing that owning attention is a valuable business asset.

## Highlights

Traditional sellers must continuously pay platforms like Amazon or Meta for discovery, creating an escalating arms race of advertising spend. [Amazon has buried organic search results](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-is-burying-organic-search-results) to the point where only four of the first twenty products shoppers see are unpaid placements.
