## Summary

“Your worst day is a chance to show your best qualities, to stand out, and to learn an enormous amount about yourself.

## Highlights
- “Your worst day is a chance to show your best qualities, to stand out, and to learn an enormous amount about yourself. Very few people plan or prepare for what they’ll do and how they’ll act during those times. Those who do might well end up turning their worst day into their best.”
- A vision gives a purpose to daily pursuits. A reason to push yourself out of bed each morning and do something. Without this purpose, it's easy to drift.
- There was something heavy in me. … I wasn’t doing the right thing. I was just trying to copy exactly everything I had learned. And I think that happens in every craft in life. You’re young. You have a master. You want to emulate them, do what they do. But at some point in life, you have to turn around and say I have to find my own way in my own language.
- I believe the way toward mastery of any endeavor is to work toward simplicity; replace complex technology with knowledge. The more you know, the less you need. From my feeble attempts at simplifying my own life I’ve learned enough to know that should we have to, or choose to, live more simply, it won’t be an impoverished life but one richer in all the ways that really matter.
- Talent and potential mean nothing if you can't consistently do things when you don't feel like doing them.

- If you're not willing to look like an idiot in the short term, you will never look like a genius in the long term.
