## Summary

The article explains “base rate” thinking: use real-world averages as your default guide.
It shows how this helps make better decisions (e.g., college apps, careers, investing).
Respecting base rates means assuming you are likely similar to the typical case unless strong evidence shows otherwise.

## Highlights

- Base rate thinking is incredibly useful — especially when applied in its explicit form (where you have a clear reference class, and a specific percentage available). But if you internalise the _style_ of thinking about base rates, one implication of this is that you will think ‘what has happened to many others may very likely happen to me as well’, and think this about many things.
