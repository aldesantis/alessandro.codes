## Summary

Rent the Runway is changing its customer service approach by proactively reaching out to new subscribers to improve their experience. The company aims to boost customer loyalty and retention through better onboarding and a larger inventory. CEO Jennifer Hyman believes these efforts will help them connect more with customers and drive future growth.

## Highlights

- Another key pillar of Rent the Runway’s strategy is growing its inventory to give customers more choice, according to Hyman. The brand found that greater depth of inventory builds customer loyalty, and 2025 will mark the company’s largest-ever inventory investment.
- The team now spends about 14% of their workdays engaging in proactive customer contact and selling to drive loyalty, according to Hyman.
