## Summary

An iROAS of 2 means the advertising (or change) generated $2 of additional revenue for every $1 spent — revenue that would not have occurred without the ads, after accounting for cannibalization and baseline demand.

## Highlights

- New products don’t just refresh the catalog and make more money; new products also reach new people you wouldn’t have captured without them.
