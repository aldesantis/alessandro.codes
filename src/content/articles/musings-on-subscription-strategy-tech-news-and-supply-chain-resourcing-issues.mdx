## Highlights

- Stock availability is critical: usually fulfilled from same stock file as standard orders, which means at peak times you’re at risk of overselling and being unable to satisfy subscription demand = cancellations >>>> reservation of stock in ERP, or buffers set in ecommerce (customised lookup that checks # subscription orders due, decrements local stock file in ecommerce to avoid sell out)
