## Summary

Every employee in the corporate world experiences a condition that can have dire consequences. It's known as "Shiny Ball Syndrome," and it can cause significant harm to both corporations and their leaders.

## Highlights
- What eCommerce operators need to understand is that in order for a subscription offering to thrive, the customer need for a subscription must exist first. In the case of subscriptions, if you build it, customers will *only* come *if* they need it.

- The point here is that you have to have an understanding of [how your consumer uses your product](https://www.futurecommerce.com/posts/insiders-132-whats-your-customers-subscription-sign), and in what context, to determine if a subscription (for convenience, gifting, or sharing) could work.

- If someone is asking you to look at subscription businesses, do be sure to include the appropriate continuity disclosures. The ‘Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act ([ROSCA](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter110&edition=prelim)) and enforcement policies from the FTC include basic guidelines like “clearly and conspicuously disclosing material terms, and avoiding [unreasonable barriers to cancellation](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/subscription-model-regulation-trends-and-takeaways).” It behooves everyone to act appropriately where subscription businesses are concerned.
