## Summary

The author reflects on navigating wellness in a complex world and the need for individualized self-care strategies. They explore the importance of small, consistent habits in improving well-being and finding balance amidst societal and personal challenges. Ultimately, the goal is to care for oneself in order to extend that care outward and make meaningful decisions.

## Highlights

- There’s a valid critique of wellness — one that I’ve made myself — that it proposes individualized solutions for structural problems. We cannot breathe our way out of structural inequalities, racism, and climate collapse.
