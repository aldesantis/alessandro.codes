## Summary

Success with AI products depends less on technology and more on how trust spreads in communities. Founders win by finding key social connectors, or “champions,” who help new ideas catch on. Understanding this social process is now the biggest advantage in launching new innovations.

## Highlights

- A wide bridge is where you have multiple points of interaction with a complex contagion—you hear about it from several different contacts. The more contacts who recommend something, the wider the bridge.
- If complex contagions require wide bridges to cross, then your first job is to find the right canyon to span.
- Whether you call them dandelions or champions, the premise is the same: To spread a complex idea, you first need to win over the most socially present individuals. But even if you find the right community and identify the right dandelion within it, you still have one final hurdle to clear.
- The founders and creators who will define the next generation are those who understand the invisible physics of how groups of people decide to trust something new. They are the ones who know how to identify a narrow community, spot the social dandelions within it, and lower the cost of adoption until saying “yes” feels like the most natural thing in the world.
