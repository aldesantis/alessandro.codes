## Summary

“You don’t need to be smarter than others to outperform them if you can out-position them.

## Highlights

- Two rules to help you be consistent with exercise this year:
  1. Show up.
  2. You can quit tomorrow.
  Repeat.
- Stick to the basics:
  Be reliable.
  Do your job.
  Speak for yourself.
  Outcome over ego.
  Focus on the details.
  See challenges as opportunities.
  Go to bed smarter than when you woke up.
- “You don’t need to be smarter than others to outperform them if you can out-position them. Anyone looks like a genius when they’re in a good position, and even the smartest person looks like an idiot when they’re in a bad one.”
- “You are under no obligation to be the same person you were five minutes ago.”
- “﻿Neither Warren nor I are smart enough to make decisions with no time to think. We make actual decisions very rapidly, but that’s because we have spent so much time preparing ourselves by quietly reading.”
