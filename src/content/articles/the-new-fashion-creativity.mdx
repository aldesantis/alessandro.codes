## Summary

Fashion creativity is evolving beyond design to encompass marketing, merchandising, and cultural influence. Successful fashion brands now focus on a collective creative stack that integrates various elements like marketing, distribution, and retail experience. Collaboration and innovation across all aspects of the fashion business are essential for success in todayâ€™s industry.

## Highlights

- Marketing, distribution, merchandising, retail experience, merch, PR are not anymore separate from collections; they are part of the same stack, and custom-made for each. This requires creative collectives in place of siloed organizations, lateral collaboration instead of top-down management, and distributed instead of centralized creativity.
