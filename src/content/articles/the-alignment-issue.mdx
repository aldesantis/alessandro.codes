- Should we leave people behind? The market says yes, constantly. Efficiency demands it. Competitive dynamics reward it. But I struggle with this. We should remain deeply uncomfortable with treating human displacement as an acceptable externality. The discomfort isn’t a bug. It’s perhaps our last defense against complete moral surrender.

- **We’ve chosen technology without art, efficiency without meaning, automation without asking what we’re automating towards.** The market rewards this separation. Competitive dynamics demand it. But Prometheus’s refusal to separate machines from art feels like the only ethical stance available.
