## Summary

Humans are evolved to learn by internalizing the skills that surround them, and education aims to make sure as many people as possible can immerse themselves in skillful communities to learn. Historically, this approach to learning has been the norm, but modernity separated everything that in traditional societies co-mingled, making it impossible for children to learn through pure imitation. However, it is now possible to construct digitally mediated rooms where experts can coexist with large numbers of novices, allowing for a return to premodern forms of knowledge transfer. The open source community is already a glass box where a novice can look in and study the workings of the machinery, but it is not built to facilitate learning.

## Highlights

- _The fundamental learning situation is one in which a person learns by helping someone who really knows what he is doing._
  – Christopher Alexander, _A Pattern Language_
- It is a question of architecture, and can be phrased as such: _How do we design workspaces where novices can enter at scale – and where they can easily observe the knowledge that guides experienced practitioners?_
  _And how can we do that without obstructing the work being done?_
- We no longer need to separate novices from the environments they are to master. At this point in our technological development, it is possible to architect workspaces where novices can _learn by doing_**,** and more importantly by _doing in the presence of competent practitioners_. We can construct digitally mediated rooms where experts can coexist with large numbers of novices, allowing for a return to premodern forms of knowledge transfer.
- In cultures where adults are unwilling to teach, it is common to see people alter how they work to make it more transparent: Aché hunters walking less briskly to accommodate less experienced animal trackers; Mayan basket weavers sitting on the ground to make it easier for their daughters to observe. This is a glass box approach.
- For apprentices to learn effectively, educators must, in a sense, let go of control. Instead of controlling the transfer of knowledge through lectures and curricula, they need to focus on ensuring apprentices have meaningful access to the environment, handing out appropriate tasks – and trusting the learner to extract knowledge out of what is going on.
- And with education, at least higher education, offline, you’ve got the physical college, then you’ve got the scanner, which is like Udacity, and Coursera and so on, which are fine companies, good companies, billion dollar companies, but they’re basically taking the college experience and putting it online. And then there’s this really interesting Terra Incognita of what does digital native education look like?
- For apprenticeships to work at scale, we need a better _mediating layer_. The mediating layer is the medium through which apprentices and masters interact. One example is the repositories themselves: these rooms that can branch off and multiply and that contain their history encoded in a chain of commits. Another is the bots that any maintainers use to answer frequently asked questions or handle pull requests. With the next generation of neural networks beyond GPT-3, we will likely see more mentor-type bots, scaling access to [1-1 mentoring](https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma/).
