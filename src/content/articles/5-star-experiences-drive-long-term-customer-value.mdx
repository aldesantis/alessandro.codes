## Summary

Customers trust, recommend, and buy more from brands with five-star experiences compared to four-star ones. Creating excellent customer experiences can lead to long-term benefits like increased customer lifetime value and higher repeat purchase rates. Companies should measure various metrics to understand the full impact of their customer experience programs.

## Highlights

- On average, 87% of customers with five-star satisfaction are somewhat or very likely to trust a brand, compared to 78% with four-star satisfaction. And 4 in 5 of consumers who feel five-star satisfaction will buy more from a brand, compared to three-quarters with four-star satisfaction.
