## Summary

The author reflects on their early writing experiences, noting that they often found the work tedious and unfulfilling, yet it helped them grow as a writer. They express concern about AI tools that promise to ease the writing process, arguing that the struggle in writing is essential to discovering and expressing ideas. Ultimately, the author believes that writing requires practice and dedication, regardless of the challenges it brings.

## Highlights
- The mechanisms of capitalism have chugged along for centuries finding cheaper and cheaper ways to outsource labour; ethicists and lawmakers have attempted to push back at various points, discouraging and criminalizing unethical wages, unsafe labour practices, and forced servitude. AI does the job for free, and you can’t illegally exploit it because it isn’t a person. It is, in some sense, a miracle of capitalism.
- When you choose to walk, you choose not to pursue immediate gratification or even comfort but simply to expand the number of things that might happen to you. Walking invests in the potentiality of your experience with almost no promise of tangible reward at all, which is something like being alive.
- In a way, these AI writing tools feel like the reverse of my first writing job: rather than requiring pure work with no meaningful end product, the tools promise the production of a meaningful product without work.
- An essay is not the process of translating a fully-formed idea into words on a page; it is the process of discovering and testing an idea by challenging it with form, syntax, structure.
- wonder if this, too, is part of the appeal of AI: it is so often humiliating to push up against the limits of your ability.
