## Summary

Marketers are facing the end of cookies for targeted advertising, but there are successful cookieless alternatives available. Recent examples show how brands have achieved impressive results with cookieless technology solutions, reaching key audiences effectively and efficiently. It’s time for marketers to prioritize preparedness for a cookieless future to continue driving successful advertising campaigns.

## Highlights

- Audience targeting segments are only available on the 53% of the web that has third-party cookies or a cross-domain identifier available. Advertisers currently activating campaigns with third-party cookies are missing out because they cannot reach almost half of the web with their targeted advertising, including the most affluent consumers who use iOS and Safari.
