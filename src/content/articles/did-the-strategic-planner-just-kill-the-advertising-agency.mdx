## Summary

It’s time for the strategic planning profession to be redeployed, at the very least, to improve efficiency and creativity, writes the founder of Australian independent agency, Thinkerbell.

## Highlights

- Perhaps it’s the fetishisation of the actual brief that is one of the biggest agency killers I’ve seen. Endless discussions about the briefing document, an artifact in an agency that has no commercial value in its own right - yet can keep an agency bogged down in pontification for months.
- If strategy is important to your agency, then give your clients strategy they can buy.
