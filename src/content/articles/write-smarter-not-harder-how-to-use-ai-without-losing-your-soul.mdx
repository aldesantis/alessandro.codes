## Summary

The playbook “Write Smarter, Not Harder” by Ty Magnin shares effective strategies for using AI in content creation without losing your personal touch. It emphasizes letting AI assist with tasks like prompt writing and drafting while maintaining your voice through structured inputs. The goal is to enhance creativity and efficiency, making AI a valuable partner rather than a replacement.

## Highlights

- Here’s how it works:
  - **Awesome**: What parts stood out or hit the mark? These are the highlights to double down on.
  - **Boring**: Where did your reader tune out? Cut, tighten, or rework these sections.
  - **Confusing**: What needed a second read? Clarify, simplify, or rephrase.
  - **Didn’t Believe**: What felt weak, sketchy, or unconvincing? Back it up with evidence, data, or a better explanation.
- AI is tempting. It fills blank pages. It automates grunt work. It finds patterns in your thinking you didn’t know were there. And that’s how your mental muscles weaken.

  To stop the “Google Mapification”of your brain — where it forgets how to think for itself — you have to pull the plug now and then. No prompts. No predictions. Just you and your own thoughts.
