## Summary

Luxury brands are increasingly looking similar due to a focus on safety and predictability, using the same creative talents and minimalist designs. This trend of homogenization limits innovation and makes it hard for new ideas to emerge. To revive their uniqueness, brands need to engage more with their audience and embrace experimentation.

## Highlights

- I believe the key luxury players are adverse to taking risks and prefer to invest in the same trusted talents who are also very loyal and interconnected one to another which makes the possibility for newcomers to emerge quite limited
- **The luxury client that all luxury brands aim to target is increasingly living similar lifestyles, visiting the same places, and often seeks to dress alike.** Additionally, these consumers frequently travel to the same luxury destinations, dine at the same exclusive restaurants, and attend the same high-profile events, reinforcing a homogeneous culture.
- Still today, brands tend to follow established trends and stick to familiar strategies instead of innovating. This is particularly evident in the recent over-reliance on archival references, as seen with new Creative Directors at brands like Chloé and Alexander McQueen. While these brands might argue they’re staying true to their roots, their failure to update these codes for today’s world often results in a lacklustre impact.
