## Summary

The current media landscape shows a surge in creator activity, yet cultural stagnation persists with an abundance of repetitive content dominating charts and platforms, leading to audience fatigue with reboots and sequels. This paradox is attributed to factors like conflicting ecosystems, institutional consolidation, and platform-driven content curation that favors mainstream over diverse offerings. The rise of a cultural oligopoly in movies, music, and other media highlights a need to address the imbalance between established content and new, innovative voices to foster a more diverse and engaging creative environment.

## Highlights

- Never before in history have new tracks attained hit status while generating so little cultural impact.

- today, from film and TV, to books, video games, and music, there’s statistically _less diversification_ rising to the top. And while it’s given that everything in culture is a remix, the intensity of today’s reliance on what’s come before seems worthy of our attention.
- The big habitually eats the small. [Movie studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_film_studios#The_majors_after_the_Golden_Age), [music labels](https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-big-music-needs-to-be-broken-up-to-save-the-industry/), [TV stations](https://awfulannouncing.com/local-networks/consolidation-local-tv-radio-newspapers-cuts.html), and publishers of [books](https://www.authorsalliance.org/2021/12/08/the-consolidation-of-publishing-houses-past-and-present/) and [video games](https://psuvanguard.com/the-consolidation-of-the-video-game-industry/) have _all_ consolidated. And this concentration is simultaneously [occurring](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/oligopoly-everywhere?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) across religion, political parties, language, top visited websites, newspapers, cities, and most discussed: wealth and businesses.
- Most consumers are simultaneously neophilic — curious to discover new things — and deeply neophobic — afraid of anything that’s too new. The best hit makers are gifted at creating moments of meaning by marrying new and old, anxiety and understanding. They are architects of familiar surprises.
- The growth of mature users on today’s content platforms recalibrates what’s surfaced and produced, diminishing the attention placed on the youthful, emerging or rebellious.
- Algorithms’ are not designed to radically free us through superior discovery. They’re made to categorize us into more predictable buckets with predetermined labels. “New” is just a wrench in this machine.
- We’re duped by a _mirage_ of new media today. In fact, we’re in a feedback loop of meta reactions. It’s a reaction video to a movie trailer which is a sequel, or a walk-through stream for the latest in a video game franchise. We have videos about a video about a video. Today, so much of bottom-up creations are nodding to legacy material. There’s less originality out there than we perceive there to be.
- We must reevaluate reach, views and ad-revenue as our go-to metrics of success, and instead aim towards the worth of _depth._ Call it the invaluable intensity of love. After all, we only care about what we can measure. And passion is a murky metric.
