## Summary

Startups often ignore lofty words like “mission” or “vision” while building products. Clear, concrete terms — Purpose, N‑year Vision, and Next Milestone — make goals actionable. Purpose is the big change you want; vision is the future state; next milestone is the immediate measurable step.

## Highlights

- The Purpose is not about us, but about others. It doesn’t mention us or what we do. It is important to us and to others, even this company didn’t exist. Transitioning to sustainable energy is a Purpose no matter which companies come and go.
- N-year Vision
  _Our desired future state: What we will have achieved?_
  Here “N” should be smaller for new companies, larger for established ones. The reason: It must detail a situation that is different from today, so that it articulates an evolution, but not so far into the future that it isn’t actionable today. Rule of thumb: Divide the age of the company by 3, and round up.
