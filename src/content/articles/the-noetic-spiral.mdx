## Summary

Navigating New Creative Rhythms

## Highlights

- I used to think gorging on inputs was the key to making connections, to building on others’ ideas. But while I filled my head with everyone else’s thoughts, I was drowning out my own voice. No space left to wonder, to ask “what do I think?”, “but why?” and “what if?”
- Look at nature itself. Trees don’t apologise for shedding their leaves. Bears don’t feel guilty about hibernating. The moon doesn’t try to stay full all month. Yet we’ve convinced ourselves that constant output, constant consumption, constant “productivity” is the only way forward.
- But we live in a world obsessed with linear progress. Our economies demand constant growth, our careers are expected to follow an ever-upward trajectory, and our minds are pushed to produce without pause. We’ve created a society that treats rest as resistance, stillness as stagnation, and cycles as setbacks.
- But what if we built our timelines differently? Not just the standard checkpoints and milestones, but deliberate pause points. A week between strategy sessions to let insights settle. Three days after customer research to spot patterns. Time set aside not for more analysis or more creation, but for the vital work of integration.
- When faced with thorny problems, our instinct is to push harder, schedule more meetings, generate more analysis. But often, our best thinking emerges when we step back. When we give ourselves permission to take that long walk after an intensive workshop. To sleep on a major decision rather than forcing an immediate answer. To let our unconscious wisdom surface through periods of apparent stillness.
