## Summary

Living, you stand under a waterfall.

## Highlights
- An empty calendar is a competitive advantage. The person who fills their calendar with average opportunities has no time for exceptional ones.
- Fear of failure is highest when you're looking at the ultimate destination. To reduce fear, close the gap. Focus on the smallest action that moves you forward.
