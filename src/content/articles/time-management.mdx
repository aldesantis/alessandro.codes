## Summary

Effective time management can create pressure and limit what we can achieve. Instead of striving for control over time, it’s better to embrace its natural flow and focus on the present. Recognizing that not everything can fit into our schedules helps us make better choices about how we spend our time.

## Highlights

- Our troubled relationship with time arises largely from this same effort to avoid the painful constrains of reality. And most of our strategies for becoming more efficient make things worse, because they’re really just ways of furthering the avoidance.
- Since hard choices are unavoidable, what matters is learning to make them consciously, deciding what to focus on and what to neglect, rather than letting them get made by default, or deceiving yourself that, with enough hard work and the right time management tricks, you might not have to make them at all.
- “missing out” is what makes your choices meaningful in the first place. Every decision to use a portion of time on anything represents the sacrifice of all the other ways in which you could have spent that time, but didn’t, and to willingly make that sacrifice is to take a stand, without reservation, on what matters most to you.
- Seeing and accepting our limited powers over our time can prompt us to question the very idea that time is something you use in the first place. There is an alternative: the notion of letting time use you, approaching life not as an opportunity to implement your predetermined plans for success but as a matter of responding to the needs of your place and your moment in history.
- freedom sometimes is to be found not in achieving greater sovereignty over your own schedule but in allowing yourself to be constrained by the rhythms of community.
- What needs doing expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
- The harder you struggle to fit everything in, the more of your time you’ll find yourself spending on the least meaningful things. This is because the more firmly you believe it ought to be possible to find time for everything, the less pressure you’ll feel to ask whether any given activity sis the best use of a portion of your time.
- smoothness is a dubious virtue, since it’s often the unsmoothed textures of life that makes them livable, helping nurture the relationships that are crucial for mental and physical health, and for the resilience of our communities. For example if you buy online the groceries you miss the chance to regularly meet with your neighbours at your local grocery store.
