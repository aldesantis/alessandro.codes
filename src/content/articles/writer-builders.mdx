## Summary

The text discusses the concept of writer-builders, individuals who excel in both writing and building in various domains. It highlights the benefits of writing for reflection, idea generation, and connecting with others. The emergence of more writer-builders is attributed to the increasing openness to career fluidity and the power of writing as a medium.

## Highlights

- I didn’t see the pattern until recently, but once I did, examples kept appearing. So I’ve started calling this archetype the _writer-builder_ — someone who both _writes_ and _builds_ in a given domain (or perhaps whichever domain they’re in for now). The writer-builder hyphenate is perhaps a sub-archetype of the aspiring _renaissance man. [[1]](https://www.workingtheorys.com/p/writer-builder?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web#footnote-1-142209042)_
- Writing clarifies your own ideas. Writing begets new ideas too. Writing lets you explore ideas in depth even if you won’t have time to act on them all. Writing shows people how you think and lets them decide if they agree, if they respect you, and if maybe you’re the kind of person they’d want to ask out for coffee or spend years working with.
- You don’t write something in one shot and hit publish. And you don’t build one version of something and call it done. Doing either well calls for copious amounts of reflection and revision too. So while not everyone has the interest or aptitude to embody the _writer-builder_ archetype, those who do have a distinctive advantage — they can unlock a virtuous cycle of revelation that levels up both.
- _Building first and then writing is like lighting a match from a lit candle. Writing before you’ve built much can be like trying to start a fire by rubbing two sticks together._ Building doesn’t have to come first, but it’s easier if it does.
