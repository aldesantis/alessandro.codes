## Summary

The article applies Pascal’s Wager to everyday interactions, emphasizing that humility leads to better outcomes than arrogance. It suggests that approaching situations with a mindset of curiosity and a willingness to learn can improve communication and relationships. By being humble, we can gain more from our interactions and avoid unnecessary conflict.

## Highlights

- You have to make assumptions of course, but Pascal points out that some assumptions fair better in all eventualities, whereas other assumptions result in positive outcomes only sometimes.
- You can’t fail if you assume you’re ignorant, that you’re missing information, that you’re ready to learn, that you need help to understand.
  It’s just Pascal’s Wager again: **Being humble cannot fail; being arrogant can**.
