## Summary

BLUF means “bottom line up front”: put your main point first so busy readers get it immediately. Give enough context in that first line to make your request or purpose actionable. Revise until your writing is clear, direct, and free of your drafting process.

## Highlights

- When you know the main point you’re going to make, you can come right out and start talking about them from the beginning. When you don’t, you have to resort to making general points that live in approximately the same neighborhood as your main point.
- When you go back and revise, one of your biggest priorities should be finding places where evidence of your own research process and thinking persists. You want your writing to communicate with maximum effectiveness to its reader, not reveal the exact route you took to reach your conclusions. That’s what will make a piece of content feel polished and complete.
