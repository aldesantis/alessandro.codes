## Summary

The text explores the trend of homogenization in public spaces driven by social media aesthetics during events like Milan Design Week. It highlights a growing nostalgia for unassuming, un-Instagrammable hangout spots that offer a sense of authenticity and comfort. Despite efforts by brands to recreate this vibe, the genuine charm of these spaces cannot be replicated or forced.

## Highlights
- Beyond the digital content machines of third-wave coffeeshops, brand pop-ups and shoppy shops, the sentimentality for *Un-Instagrammable-Hang-Zones* is about feeling sentimental for a time before the loneliness epidemic had become a defining characteristic of modern life.
