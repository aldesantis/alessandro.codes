## Summary

We unpack the new culture of back-to-school and what it means for brands vying for share in this redefined season.

## Highlights

- Back-to-school shopping has traditionally been a chore, simply a box that requires checking. Social media, however, has made it an “inspirational, creator-driven experience,” according to Ally Anderson, Director of Strategy & Insights, Brand Partnerships at LTK. One that enhances the feeling of social connection and belonging that Gen Z consumers are still feeling and experiencing in their physical lives, especially as they [flock to malls](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/consumer-markets/library/back-to-school-education-spending.html) to shop with their peers.
- “logic dictates that rising costs will negatively impact tariffed products like calculators or apparel. On the other hand, back-to-school is a unique event with limited substitution and generally lower elasticities. If a parent needs to buy a calculator for their child to be successful, they will find a way to do so even if the price of that calculator is higher due to tariffs.”
- The back-to-school shopping season of 2025 isn’t just a retail event; it’s a cultural referendum on how we construct identity, negotiate family dynamics, and perform belonging in an age of perpetual visibility.
- A single haul video serves dual purposes, offering budget-friendly “dupes” to anxious millennials while simultaneously establishing the cultural cachet of the original for their Gen Z offspring. Authenticity becomes not just another product to be optimized, but a multi-faceted performance calibrated to resonate across generational divides.
- When everyday consumers become micro-influencers through their haul videos and product reviews, the traditional power structures of retail marketing collapse. Every purchase becomes a potential performance, every shopping trip a content opportunity.
