## Summary

Several countries have laws to ensure products can be shared, reused, repaired or recycled.

## Highlights

- When selling products, offer a take-back policy for old items (e.g. in-store recycling boxes for worn clothes, free pick up of old electronics when delivering the new ones).
  People will be willing to pay a higher price.
