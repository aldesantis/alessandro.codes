## Summary

A24 is an independent movie studio known for its unique storytelling and marketing strategies. To grow its brand, A24 should expand its influence beyond movies into areas like fashion and literature, becoming a cultural tastemaker. This approach will help A24 maintain its relevance and connect with diverse audiences.

## Highlights
- To play as a tastemaker across multiple cultural fields, A24 needs to build a brand. This brand goes beyond an independent movie studio. Movies are one way to tell a story, and A24’s job is to figure out what other narrative devices are at its disposal.
- *House of Brands.* This was A24’s original brand architecture, where its entertainment products are all positioned, developed, and marketed independently from one another. There is a shared POV and values (empowering creative risk-taking) but the brand is a portfolio of disconnected cultural products.
  *Source Brand.* With production of its own movies, A24 started having a “source code” that all its producst share. Products are still heroes, and are positioned independently from each other and from the master brand, but this positioning is now aligned.
  *Endorsed Brand.* In this model, A24 has opportunity to apply its taste-making filter in different cultural areas — fashion, sports, toys, games, literature, hospitality, CPG, beauty, design … Without having to produce cultural output in all these different areas, A24 can curate the already existing output. This brand model asks what are other ways to tell a story and how to use diverse cultural products to build a narrative world. Endorsed brands are not defined by their category; rather, they are *a mode of participating in culture.*
