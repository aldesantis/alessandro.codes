## Summary

However — because Ridge, HexClad, Lomi & Pela Case, Jones Road Beauty, and Grüns (one of the most popular recent guests on the podcast) all trust Postscript with their SMS — here are a few unsponsored posts from the leaders at those brands.

## Highlights

- If only 20% of your eventual purchasers convert inside 30 days, even if the new channel ultimately performs identically to Meta, your best possible observed ROAS inside a 30-day evaluation window is ~20% of the long-run number.
  So if Meta’s true long-run 5x translates to only 1x inside 30 days, pulling the plug at day 30 is like giving up on your new apple tree two days after planting the seeds.
- I am most comfortable scaling when lag-adjusted ROAS ≥ hurdle, quality metrics in-line or better, and I keep seeing channel-specific CAC falling with more spend + optimization.
