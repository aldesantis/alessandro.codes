Will We See the First Programmable Organisations In 2025?

## Summary

By 2025, organizations may become “programmable,” using AI to enhance management and work coordination. This shift aims to automate processes while promoting human creativity, leading to more agile and efficient enterprises. As companies adopt AI, they will need to rethink their structures and management roles to fully realize these benefits.

## Highlights

- Organisations can be more automated and machine-like at the back-end platform level in order to be more human and connected at the front end.
