## Summary

Amazon’s Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) program revolutionized e-commerce logistics by allowing sellers to store their products in Amazon’s warehouses and benefit from fast shipping. Over the years, FBA has become essential for sellers, making it easier to manage orders and reach customers, although it has also led to rising costs for some. As Amazon continues to expand its logistics capabilities, FBA remains a key factor in its success in the e-commerce market.

## Highlights

- According to Haire, FBA fees have increased substantially among his clients, rising from approximately 24% of the sales price to 50% or more.
