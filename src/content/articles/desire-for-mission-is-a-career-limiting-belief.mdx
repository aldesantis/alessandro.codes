## Summary

Desiring a mission in your career can be limiting, similar to seeking a high salary, as it restricts the job opportunities you consider. While some career-limiting beliefs are optional and can be adjusted throughout life, prioritizing mission can be a privilege rather than a necessity. It’s suggested that in the early stages of a career or when faced with limited options, temporarily setting aside the need for mission can open up more opportunities for growth and fulfillment. The document explores how various career factors, such as compensation, skills development, and growth potential, can impact career choices, emphasizing that the importance of mission in a job may vary depending on individual circumstances.

## Highlights

- Mission is optional. It’s a privilege. It’s amazing if you can find a job that pays well, teaches you rare and valuable skills, _and_ allows you to execute against a world-changing, society-benefiting goal. But such jobs are incredibly rare! If you can’t find one, it seems reasonable to temporarily lift the requirement for mission. This is especially true in the early years of your career, or whenever it is you realise that you have a limited menu of options to choose from.
