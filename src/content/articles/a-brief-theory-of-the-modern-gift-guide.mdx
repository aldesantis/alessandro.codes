## Summary

Gift guides have evolved from expensive magazine ads to helpful resources that ease the pressure of finding the perfect present. They connect readers with unique, thoughtful gift ideas that reflect the recipient’s personality. Modern gift guides, often shared through newsletters, aim to make consumerism more meaningful by showcasing small businesses and personalized recommendations.

## Highlights

- Online shopping is a nightmare. There is too much fucking stuff. Even if you only shop at the places where you’ve shopped before, there’s _still_ much fucking stuff. And what gift guides _and_ advertisements do is _tell you something exists_.
- Optimization culture calls for us all to give _perfect gifts_ to every person in our lives, no matter how opaque or punishingly specific their tastes may be.
