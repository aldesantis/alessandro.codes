## Summary

Lawrence Yeo reflects on his popular post, “Travel Is No Cure for the Mind,” which has resonated with over a million readers. He argues that while travel can provide new experiences, it doesn’t solve inner discontent and can often just be an escape from daily life. True contentment comes from being curious and grateful in our everyday surroundings, not from external travels.

## Highlights

- This is why taking a 7-day cruise ship around the coastline of some popular tourist destination is not a form of curiosity-driven travel. The goal of a cruise is to keep you as comfortable as possible while introducing small hits of novelty to create the illusion that you’re “traveling.” Your introduction to any new cultures is confined within a bubble of familiarity that’s been carefully engineered to shield you from fear.
- When travel is used as a vehicle to break the monotony of life, then don’t be surprised when that sense of monotony finds itself to whatever newfound place you’re visiting.
- A curious mindset doesn’t ignite just because your surroundings have changed. Rather, it’s something to be cultivated in your current state – in your day-to-day life – whether you’re working in a cubicle or having the 1,000th meal in your apartment or home. Instead of trying to break away from this, use that desire for escape as a signal for you to look deeper at your life as it is today.
