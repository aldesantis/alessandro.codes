## Summary

Shopify is at the intersection of commerce, payments, and debt, making it a key player in the evolving online retail landscape. As new store growth slows, Shopify is focusing on strengthening relationships with existing merchants and expanding its lending services through Shopify Capital. However, rising consumer debt and economic pressures pose risks to its financial growth strategy.

## Highlights

- In 2024, Shopify Capital became an understated yet vital piece of Shopify’s growth strategy. In Q2 of this year, Shopify originated $700 million in loans. Shopify CFO Jeff Hoffmeister referred to this arm of the company as a “growth business,” highlighting its increasing importance.
- Shopify is no longer just a commerce platform; it has evolved into a multi-faceted financial services provider, using its intimate knowledge of merchants’ sales data to offer targeted lending products.
