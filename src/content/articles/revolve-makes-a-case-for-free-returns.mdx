## Summary

Revolve has successfully reduced its return rate while still offering free shipping both ways. The company has implemented new technologies and policies to improve sizing guidance and encourage customers to keep their purchases. Despite the challenges of high return rates in e-commerce, Revolve’s recent progress suggests a positive trend for the future.

## Highlights

- Importantly, Revolve improved the sizing guidance it gives shoppers. In a survey last year, the company found that two-thirds of returns related to size and fit. To address the issue, it has introduced features such as product fit guides, a size-comparison tool to provide sizing recommendations and virtual try-on. It also introduced product videos for certain brands.
