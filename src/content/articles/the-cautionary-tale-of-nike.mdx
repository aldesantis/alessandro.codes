## Summary

Nike, once a leader in branding and innovation, is now facing significant challenges, including a 30% drop in stock due to poor strategic decisions. Critics argue that the company has shifted its focus from serving athletes to chasing broader markets, leaving it vulnerable to upstart competitors. Additionally, its emphasis on direct-to-consumer sales over brand-building has diluted its identity and effectiveness.

## Highlights

- The most immediate opportunities in the content process lie in areas like tagging, inserting links to related articles, testing headlines and the like. As Brian warns, thereâ€™s no point in using AI in a way that eliminates the competitive advantage of having a distinct voice.
