## Summary

Returns not only cost retailers money but also strain their operations and inventory management. High return rates can lead to dead stock, markdowns, and missed sales opportunities, affecting overall efficiency. Brands need to analyze returns data and improve processes to reduce waste and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Highlights
- Thereâ€™s a false belief in retail that more conversions are always better. We see brands obsess over increasing conversion rates (CVR) with free returns, discounts, and heavy marketing spends. But when the focus is purely on converting more customers without accounting for the return impact, this growth is short-sighted.
- Tracking returns by SKU, reason, and time frame allows you to identify patterns that might not be immediately obvious. For instance, are certain products being returned more frequently due to sizing issues? Or is quality a recurring problem? Understanding why customers return products gives you the insights needed to fix root causes, rather than simply reacting to the financial impact.
