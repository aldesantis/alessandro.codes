## Summary

What multi-channel attribution models deliver value when marketing across devices (TV, phones, tablets) & channels (search, display, social)?

## Highlights
- The primary challenge is that as we switch devices it is increasingly difficult to keep track of the same person as they interface with our digital existence (and are exposed to online and offline marketing and advertising). Actually, I should not say increasingly difficult, I should say almost impossible (cookies, uuids, privacy, government, et al).

- Next time you hear someone utter the words multi-channel attribution, the single greatest gift you can give yourself is to ask in your sweetest possible voice: "Are you referring to MCA-O2S, MCA-AMS or MCA-ADC?"
