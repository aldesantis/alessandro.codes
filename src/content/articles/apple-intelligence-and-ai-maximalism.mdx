## Summary

Apple is exploring generative AI through a different lens than other tech giants. They are focusing on embedding AI into user contexts and creating a split between context and world models. By leveraging their own software and hardware, Apple is shaping a unique path in the AI landscape.

## Highlights
- And, surely, the foundation model that Apple built itself to run in its private cloud IS a ‘world model’, and you *could* ask it for pizza recipes- it’s just that so far, Apple has decided not to offer that UI. Apple is letting OpenAI take the brand risk of creating pizza glue recipes, and making error rates and abuse someone else’s problem, while Apple watches from a safe distance.
- Commoditisation is often also integration. There was a time when ‘spell check’ was a separate product that you had to buy, for hundreds of dollars, and there were dozens of competing products on the market, but over time it was integrated first into the word processor and then the OS. The same thing happened with the last wave of machine learning - style transfer or image recognition were products for five minutes and then became features. Today ‘summarise this document’ is AI, and you need a cloud LLM that costs $20/month, but tomorrow the OS will do that for free. ‘AI is whatever doesn’t work yet.’
