## Summary

Startup founders often experience a profound sadness after selling their company, even if the sale is successful. This is because a startup becomes part of their personal identity and selling it feels like selling a piece of themselves. The loss of identity and the search for a new one can lead to feelings of mourning and uncertainty. While selling a startup may be the right choice, founders need to be prepared for the emotional impact and consider their own fulfillment beyond financial success. Startups evolve over time, and founders must be willing to adapt to new roles and responsibilities as the company grows. Ultimately, the decision to sell or continue building a startup depends on individual circumstances and aspirations.

- > _“I sell my artwork on Etsy. Want to see?“—Barista at an Austin coffee shop_
  If you ask her, “Who are you?” She would answer: “I’m an artist.”
  If you ask her, “What do you do for a living?” She would answer: “I’m a barista, but that’s just my day job. Want to see my artwork?”
  Is she a barista because she pours coffee for money? Is she a driver because she drives a car to work? Is she a maid because she cleans her own apartment?
  No, **she’s an artist** because **that’s what she _really_ is**. “Barista” is one of many necessary means to the ends, where the “ends” are the basic human needs, followed by creating art, I guess with some [Maslow layers](https://longform.asmartbear.com/needs-stack/) in-between.

- I went to find the pot of gold
  That’s waiting where the rainbow ends.
  I searched and searched and searched and searched
  And searched and searched, and then…
  There it was, deep in the grass,
  Under an old and twisty bough.
  It’s mine, it’s mine, it’s mine at last…
  What do I search for now?
  —_Shel Silverstein, _Where the Sidewalk Ends__
