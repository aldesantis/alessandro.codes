## Summary

I hope you had a relaxing weekend, shared some laughs, and got outside for a little bit. I spent my weekend under the world’s biggest blanket (this one) because it was freezing in New York!

## Highlights

- As far as historical data about what happens during election years there are a lot of different reports. In general, I think brands should prepare for a 10-30% increase in CPMs across the entirety of their spending compared to last year. Obviously, this is highly dependent on your category, targeting, ad creative, etc., but that’s what I’ve seen.
