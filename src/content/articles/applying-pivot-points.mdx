## Summary

Pivot Points are personal strengths or weaknesses that can help or hinder us in different situations. By understanding and leveraging these Pivot Points, both individuals and companies can create better strategies for success. Embracing our Pivot Points allows us to align our lives and businesses with our true capabilities, leading to greater fulfillment and effectiveness.

## Highlights

- Pivot Points are strengths in some situations, hinderances in others, and irrelevant in still others. This is why I don’t like the ideas of “strengths” and “weaknesses” generally—whether in personality tests or [SWOTs](https://longform.asmartbear.com/swot/) or other tools of strategy and planning. Those frameworks imply that we already know the context for evaluation, but often we don’t. Pivot Points are neither intrinsically good nor bad, they just _are_.
- Short-term planning should assume Pivot Points are fixed, because in the short term, they are. Long-term planning, especially when deciding where to [investing your time and money](https://longform.asmartbear.com/investment/), can ask: What new Pivot Points do we want?
- [Write-storming](https://www.fastcompany.com/3033567/brainstorming-doesnt-work-try-this-technique-instead?utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_medium=post) is brainstorming in which participants write ideas in isolation, then bring them together for deduplication and enhancement. This eliminates the bias towards the fastest, loudest voice, supports people whose brains need more time to ponder, takes advantage of background-processing (i.e. “I thought of something in the shower”), and more fully includes non-native speakers who will be much more precise and compelling when given time to translate.
- How do we do even more things that leverage multiple Pivot Points? When we do that, not only are we perfectly suited to it, they are automatically differentiating in the competitive market, because others would have trouble copying us, because their Pivot Points are different from ours.
- If the rewards are 1/4 of what you think they will be, and it takes 2x longer than you think it will take, is it still a _no-brainer_ to do it? Not just “good” but a “no-brainer,” like you almost have to do it?
