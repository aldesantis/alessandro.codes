## Summary

Customer loyalty programs are increasingly popular as businesses seek to differentiate themselves in a competitive market. However, not all loyalty programs guarantee success, as seen with Bed Bath & Beyond’s generic coupon approach. To measure the effectiveness of a loyalty program, brands must set clear goals, track incremental revenue, and carefully analyze costs. Sophisticated methods like difference-in-difference analysis can provide a more accurate picture of the program’s impact, while considering both tangible and intangible rewards is crucial for calculating return on investment. Understanding customer behavior and feedback is also essential in evaluating the true success of a loyalty program.

## Highlights

- From our experience, difference-in-difference analysis is the most effective. This method measures incremental revenue by comparing the change in revenue from loyalty program members before and after joining the program against the change in revenue from a control group of nonmembers over the same period. This helps to control for external factors affecting both groups, providing a clearer picture of the program’s true impact.
- Propensity score matching (PSM) is also sometimes used, which involves matching each loyalty program member with a nonmember who has a similar profile, or “propensity” to join, based on characteristics like past purchase behavior or demographics. A key issue with PSM is that it can be logistically challenging and expensive to implement.
- These methods help in accurately isolating the impact of the loyalty program from inherent customer behaviors, but similarly, understanding the costs involves dissecting rewards into categories:
  - **Tangibles:** This includes the cost of items given as rewards, factoring in costs of goods sold.
  - **Services:** For rewards like exclusive events, the cost is determined by the expense of delivering the service, divided by the number of customers benefiting from it.
  - **Discounts:** The cost here is the revenue foregone by offering products or services at reduced prices.
  - **Intangibles:** Rewards like early access or special features typically have no marginal cost to the brand.
