## Summary

Before we get into it, I want to thank this week’s sponsor: Proppel.

## Highlights

- Once your business hits $50M/year you’ll typically have enough traffic and sales volume to run one statistically significant test per month. This is where it might make sense to invest in a CRO agency. At $100M+/year, you can consider bringing the function in-house.
- If you A/B test your homepage hero banner, the version featuring a sale or promo message is always going to convert better. This is true across your site. It almost isn’t worth testing.
  ​
  That said, there are downstream effects. You can shift customers who had full price purchase intent into sale purchases. If you lean on this strategy, it will become harder to sell at full price over time.
