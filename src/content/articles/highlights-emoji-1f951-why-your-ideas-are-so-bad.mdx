## Summary

This is a field in Alto Del Perdon, Spain. Watch the video here.

## Highlights

- At the beginning of a creative session, **see through** every bad idea that comes to mind. Instead of being self-critical and resisting bad ideas, recognize that you must see them to completion.
- Once bad ideas are emptied, a surprising thing happens: better ideas begin to arrive. Here’s my guess as to why: **Once you’ve generated enough bad output, your mind reflexively identifies which elements caused the badness**. Then it becomes better at avoiding them. You start pattern-matching interesting ideas with greater intuition.
- Resonance is expressing an idea so honestly in today’s sensibilities that you fixate people on it and make it worth remembering. Resonance is _relatable storytelling_ that surfaces a truth about life. For a moment, it takes over the audience’s mind and they’re forced to grapple with it.
