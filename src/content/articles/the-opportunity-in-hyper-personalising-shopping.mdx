## Summary

Fashion brands are using AI and Big Data to personalize online shopping experiences for customers. Personalization is crucial for brands to connect with consumers in a competitive market. Companies must invest in data collection and analytics to deliver hyper-personalized e-commerce content and experiences.

## Highlights

- Offering hyper personalisation will require companies to reimagine how e-commerce operates. Search-based shopping is likely to shift to the individualised discovery of products and styles offered in the right size and fit. All customers will have a curated experience on their own versions of brand websites and marketplaces, from landing page to payment, akin to their experience on social media feeds. With this, companies will use personalisation technology to build experiences that drive customer engagement and, ultimately, loyalty.
