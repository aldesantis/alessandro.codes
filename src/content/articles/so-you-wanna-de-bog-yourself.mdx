## Summary

The article offers advice on how to get “unstuck” when feeling overwhelmed with life’s challenges. The author compares the feeling of being stuck to standing knee-deep in a bog and offers a catalog of bog phenomena that keep people stuck, such as waiting for a jackpot, declining the dragon, and puppeteering. The author suggests that many of these bogs are imaginary and that getting out of them requires accepting that one’s perception of reality is not necessarily reality.

## Highlights

- Whenever you chicken out, you don’t just feel the pain of cowardice; you miss out on the pleasure of courage.
- Some problems are like getting a diploma: you work at it for a while, and then you’re done forever. Learning how to ride a bike is a classic _diploma problem_.
  But most problems aren’t like that. They’re more like _toothbrushing problems_: you have to work at them forever until you die. You can’t, as far as I know, just brush your teeth really really well and then let ‘em ride forever.
- A good word for this is _puppeteering_: trying to solve your problems by controlling the actions of other humans. Puppeteering often looks attractive because other people’s actions seem silly and therefore easily changeable. Funnily enough, it doesn’t feel that way to them.
- This is _obsessing over tiny predictors_. It’s scary to admit that you can’t control the future; it’s a lot easier to distract yourself by trying to optimize every decision, no matter how insignificant.
