## Summary

Some brands selling on Amazon’s marketplace say the economics of operating have become difficult. One big reason: returns.

## Highlights

- I think the level and the quality of customers [on Amazon] is a little bit different compared to those buying from a regular e-commerce brand, where they might be more invested in the brand. Whereas, for us, on Amazon there was almost no [brand] relationship. I think it’s very unemotional when the purchase happens and the decision is mostly dictated by price.
