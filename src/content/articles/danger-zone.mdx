## Summary

The article maps four brand strategies—aspirational, luxury, mass, and failed “last chance”—and explains how each can become vulnerable. Brands lose standing when consumers see poor value, shift up or down, or seek uniqueness and trendiness elsewhere. Knowing these danger zones helps firms preempt threats and adjust strategy.

## Highlights

- Brands that pursue aspirational strategy have both wide appeal and relative differentiation, allowing them to enjoy both high margins and high sales volumes. They are also in danger when their items are perceived as not worth the price they command so aspirational consumers switch to lower priced, mass offerings; when aspirational consumers’ economic circumstances change; or where the perception of differentiation falters.
