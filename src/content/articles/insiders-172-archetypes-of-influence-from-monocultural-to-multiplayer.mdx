## Summary

The text discusses how influence in marketing has shifted from traditional celebrities to everyday people, impacting consumer behavior and brand perceptions. It highlights the emergence of various influencer archetypes, from celebrities to micro-influencers on platforms like TikTok, showcasing the evolution towards authenticity and relatability in influencing consumer decisions. Brands are adapting to this shift by partnering with influencers who align with their values to drive engagement and build brand loyalty in a diverse, community-driven influencer landscape.

## Highlights

- Twitter democratized the interaction between celebrities and their fans. It allowed for a level of immediacy and intimacy that was otherwise impossible.
- Media theorist Henry Jenkins has argued that, when the barrier of entry is sufficiently low that anyone who desire to participate, can; we will see the rise of participatory culture. TikTok has democratized commerce, allowing everyday consumers to actively engage with and influence brands, obliterating the lines between creators and consumers.
