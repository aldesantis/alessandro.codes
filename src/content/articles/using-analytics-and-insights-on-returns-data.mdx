## Summary

Analyzing returns data is crucial for fashion brands to understand and improve their returns rates. By merging returns insights with sales data, brands can identify issues with specific products and optimize their inventory management. Implementing a paid returns policy can help offset costs, but it’s essential to balance it with customer experience to maintain sales.

## Highlights

- Many online fashion brands are now experiencing return rates of up to 50%, processing 3-4k returns every day.
- But apart from the obvious manpower that’s involved, high returns rates wreak havoc on a brand’s P&L - inventory lives in limbo, margins are skewed, and costs skyrocket.
- The average cost of returns needs to be known, not necessarily to be the determining factor for how much you should be charging customers for returns, but more so as a way to know how much returns are costing the brand, and looking at how you can offset the costs of returns in a more holistic way.
