## Summary

Good strategy involves understanding both feelings (affect) and thinking (cognition). Ignoring emotions can limit strategic options and make it harder to implement change. Acknowledging affect leads to better decision-making and smoother execution of strategies.

## Highlights

- for strategy to be good, it must also understand affect and how it affects cognition and action.[1](https://vaughntan.org/strataffect#footnote-1AUB) (Affect is the experience of feelings in general, which can be quite diffuse. Emotion is part of affect and is more intense and usually directed at something specific.)
- Acknowledging affect in strategy-making makes it harder for organisations to avoid inconvenient but important truths and also encourages more adaptive, reality-based strategy-making.
- Change is disruptive. Even when a strategy is well-reasoned and necessary, it forces people to abandon familiar ways of working and do new things. [Novelty and uncertainty provoke feelings of anxiety, frustration, or outright resistance.](https://vaughntan.org/why-not-knowing-feels-so-hard) People who feel unsettled by change are less likely to support it — and more likely to slow it down or try to block it. Strategy that fails to acknowledge these kinds of responses is much harder to successfully implement.
- These approaches are part of what I call “[sneaky strategies](https://uncertaintymindset.substack.com/i/110030503/sneaky-strategies).” Unlike [big, top-down strategic plans that look great on boardroom slides but get stuck in execution](https://vaughntan.org/embeddedstrat), sneaky strategies work by **avoiding friction** and **slipping past organizational defenses.**
