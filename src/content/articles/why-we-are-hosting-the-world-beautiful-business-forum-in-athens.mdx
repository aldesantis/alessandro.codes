## Summary

The House of Beautiful Business will celebrate its tenth anniversary in 2026 with a special event called the World Beautiful Business Forum in Athens. This four-day gathering will bring together creative and bold thinkers to explore new ways of doing business that focus on imagination, beauty, and human connection. The forum aims to welcome more people worldwide and inspire change in how business is done for a better future.

## Highlights

- If you’ve joined us before, you know: HoBB events are not conventional conferences. Instead of PowerPoints, we host deep conversations, silent dinners, ideation walks, simulations, social experiments, public readings—even football matches. Instead of panels, we convene long-form debates in intimate and expansive formats, and we go into the field. Music, dance, and theater are not sideshows—they are central to the program. We draw from a rich tapestry of intelligences, disciplines, and cultures. We eschew tidy frameworks and predefined outcomes in favor of complexity, paradox, and the most audacious ideas—including those that resist resolution.
