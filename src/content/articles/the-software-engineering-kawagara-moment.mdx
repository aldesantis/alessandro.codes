## Summary

Software engineering is experiencing a major shift due to the rise of AI coding tools that automate many tasks. This change is affecting job markets, especially for junior engineers, who need to adapt by focusing on more complex, end-to-end product development. While AI will take over some roles, there will still be a need for human engineers in understanding business needs, product design, and system setup.

## Highlights

- This isn’t where the real upheaval is coming from. Vibe coding is like owning a high-end oven at home: it enables more people to experiment and create, but it doesn’t replace professional chefs in restaurants.
  Similarly, people casually using GPT to script a spreadsheet or using a “no code” tool to build a personal app aren’t threatening the software engineering profession. They’re expanding the ecosystem.
  The real disruption comes from tools that automate professional workflows.
