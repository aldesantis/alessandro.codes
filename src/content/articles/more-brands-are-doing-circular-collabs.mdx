## Summary

Brands like eBay, Depop, and Vestiaire Collective are partnering to promote circular fashion through collaborations and partnerships. These online marketplaces are leading the charge in transforming the fashion industry towards sustainability. Trust, transparency, and community engagement are crucial for success in the circular fashion movement.

## Highlights

- Through its use of unique cross-cultural collaborations and activation, eBay has positioned itself as a leader in New Luxury circularity; by connecting with younger audiences (Gen-Z in particular) it has championed shopping for hyped sneakers and luxury fashion via pre-loved marketplaces, whilst collaborating with experts to ensure shoppers can trust buyers and the products theyâ€™re purchasing.
- New Luxury consumers, Gen-Z in particular, _can_ and _will_ see through the BS. The messaging and direction of a circular initiative need to serve a purpose and be actionable; this will reflect in the results.
