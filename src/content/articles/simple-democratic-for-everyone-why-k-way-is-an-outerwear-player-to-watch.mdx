## Summary

K-Way, an Italian outerwear brand with a rich French heritage, is celebrating its 60th anniversary with a special exhibition and runway show during Milan Fashion Week. The brand, known for its affordable and packable nylon jackets, has recently received a €190 million investment to expand its presence beyond Italy, France, and Belgium. Co-CEO Lorenzo Boglione aims to make K-Way as recognizable in new markets like the UK, Asia, and the US as it is in its home countries.

## Highlights

- Boglione’s father, Marco, acquired the rights to K-Way in 2004 for €8 million. His innovatively operated Turin company, BasicNet, was already operating Kappa and Jesus Jeans. Today, it also owns Superga and Sebago, among others. In 2023, BasicNet reported revenues of €396.8 million, of which K-Way represented €147.7 million.
