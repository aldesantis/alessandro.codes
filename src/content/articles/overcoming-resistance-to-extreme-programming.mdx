## Summary

Extreme Programming (XP) can bring joy and effectiveness to teams, but many resist its practices due to unfamiliarity and management incentives that prioritize individual performance. Managers can support collaborative working by giving teams control over their processes and encouraging them to try new methods without coercion. Creating a supportive environment, where practice and collaboration are prioritized, helps teams discover the benefits of XP.

## Highlights

- Supportive managers have significant power to influence ways of working, but can only invite and encourage ways of working; coercion cannot create teams that take control.
- You can help through individual coaching; asking the right questions and inviting people to discover better ways and why, themselves. Beware advising people to do things the way that worked for you, instead be curious, and ask how you can help rather than imposing your help.
