## Summary

In this guide I’m going to cover the pillars of an effective email marketing program for fashion brands.

## Highlights

- There is a maximum dollar value the folks on your list will be able to spend with you (few would go hungry to buy a new bag). Your job is to capture as much of that potential value as you can. The “email as intrusion” approach is leaving money on the table, while the “money tree” approach burns out your list prematurely.
- ​But you don’t necessarily _need_ a promotion to drive email opt-in; some of your customers will opt into your brand’s emails at checkout. If you decide to forgo the discount, you’ll have to work from the assumption that most of your new subscribers will come from customers checking out.
- Your brand’s biggest fans and advocates will stay on your list just to read whatever content you put out, but that represents a small portion of your audience. The more you’re able to entertain or inform with your email content, the less you’ll need to rely on discounts to keep folks opted in.
- The best way to approach email cadence is to break out your list based on subscriber engagement like this:
  - Most engaged: email every day (or more)
  - Average engagement: email 3-4x/week
  - Low engagement: email 1-2x/week
  - Stopped engaging: email 1x/month

- • If you’re in a full price period, emails featuring best sellers will always perform best.
  - Email is a great low-cost channel for introducing new products and testing new merchandising stories/angles.
  - People tend to buy more of what they already bought until they become “loyal”.
- ​Segmentation is only worthwhile if you’re able to send each segment different email content _and_ that difference is meaningful enough to drive incremental sales. I’ve seen too many brands build and manage 5+ segments, only to send everyone the same content at the same frequency.

  Most effective email A/B tests are pattern disrupters e.x. a 2-word subject line when you usually send 14 words, or a plain text email when you usually send image slices. But when these disruptions become standard practice, they lose their effectiveness.
- Send time testing. Your subscribers will open your emails at whatever time you send them regularly. There isn’t a magical “optimal send time” that will help you “beat out the competition”–everyone’s inbox is different.
