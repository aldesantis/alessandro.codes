## Summary

Brands should view transparency on Product Detail Pages (PDPs) as an opportunity to build trust and loyalty with consumers, rather than just a regulatory requirement. By clearly displaying sustainability information and making it relatable, companies can attract conscious buyers and gain a competitive advantage. Embracing transparency can help brands stand out and contribute to a more ethical fashion industry.

## Highlights

- The level to which transparency information is both a competitive advantage for brands, and something consumers actually give a s**t about is how relatable these numbers are. There is little point in a brand going to the cost and effort of delivering transparency information to consumers, if the end result is something that consumers simply donâ€™t engage with.
