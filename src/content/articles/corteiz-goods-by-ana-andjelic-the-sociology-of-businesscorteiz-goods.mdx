Corteiz Goods

## Summary

The rebirth of subculture

## Highlights

- The power of established brands is expressed through price, and through ability of brands to protect it in the competitive setting. The power of emerging brands is in their desirability strategy, and their ability to _not_ compete on price. This strategy rests less on market positioning and more on savviness of brands to create cultural and social capital.
