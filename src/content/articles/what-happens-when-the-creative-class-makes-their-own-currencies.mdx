## Summary

The essay explores how digital art and NFTs challenge traditional models of creativity and compensation by emphasizing spreadability over rarity. It discusses the concept of the aspirational economy and how the project "Higher" engages different types of consumers to enhance its virality and community participation. Overall, the text suggests a shift towards defining value in contemporary art based on circulation and participation within decentralized communities in the digital age.

## Highlights
- Paradoxically, an object whose image is very widely spread is a rare object, in the sense that few objects have their images spread widely. This can be exploited to create value in art objects that are not in the traditional sense rare and singular. The future of collecting may be less in owning the thing that nobody else has, and more in owning the thing that everybody else has.

- Value in the contemporary art world is increasingly defined by spreadability rather than traditional notions of rarity or originality. Increasingly, crypto wonâ€™t just be about ownership, but about participation and circulation within a decentralized community.
