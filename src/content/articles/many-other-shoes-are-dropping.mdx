## Summary

The author reflects on the evolving role of writing in making sense of the world and explores how different narratives shape creative projects. They discuss the excitement and challenges of living in a time where significant historical arcs are converging, with the anticipation of major technological developments. Despite writing feeling less culturally significant in 2024, the author finds value in persisting through challenging periods to capture the essence of the changing times.

## Highlights

- Being derailed is not a bad thing though. Never being derailed is as bad as always getting derailed.
- I think I’m something that could not have exited before the internet. I write connected skeins of essays that are somewhat, but not entirely, serializable, and do poorly when ripped from a hyperlinked context. It’s not great for archival, accessibility, or legibility at scale, but I think it is well-suited to making sense of the world in real time while also enjoying the luxury of a bit of poiesis through writing. It is living, breathing text of a sort only the internet allows you to generate.
- History is a messy thing. Theorizing it is difficult. If you’re lucky, sometimes things get easy or exciting for brief periods.
- If you yearn for a break from the past, history is very breakable at the moment. It’s not quite a liminal-epic evolutionary bottleneck, but it’s close. The fan of possible futures right now is as wide as it’s ever been in my lifetime.
- Is writing to sense-make a useful thing to be doing? (for me, not you; utility to you is a side effect). If not useful, is it at least interesting or exciting? If neither, is there some other mode of writing that’s a richer way of being in the world today? If not, is there something other than writing I could/should be doing?
