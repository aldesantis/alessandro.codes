Fundamentals of modern loyalty

## Summary

To earn customer loyalty, offer community, not rewards

## Highlights
- The irony of most of today’s customer loyalty programs is that they aren’t about loyalty at all. They have more to do with an economic transaction than with true affinity for a brand. For example: some companies allow you to earn points for following them or writing a product review. This sort of bribery usually attracts the least loyal and least valuable audience — people mostly interested in claiming the reward not invested in the brand.

- True loyalty is emotional and irrational and leads to customers feeling like they’re part of an exclusive membership group which then leads them to become loyal subscribers or consumer network participants.

- To prevent reverse network effects and maintain a high signal-to-noise ratio, brands often focus on specific customer sub-segments and overdeliver for them.
- Groups that do a good job of connecting members with one another — virtually or in person — are sticky and grow stronger over time.
- Research shows that consumers prefer small repeated gains and incremental rewards over big infrequent ones. So membership programs need to offer a steady stream of touchpoints.
