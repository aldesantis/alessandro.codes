## Summary

Entropy, a concept linked to disorder, highlights why life tends to become more complex over time. The increase in entropy affects various aspects of daily life, leading to disorder and decay. Rudolf Clausius identified entropy, which plays a role in heat transfer and the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy also impacts business and economics, where efforts are needed to minimize disorder and maintain order through constant energy expenditure. In everyday life, combating entropy requires energy to prevent things from becoming disorganized and chaotic, emphasizing the constant effort needed to maintain order in a world naturally inclined towards disorder.

## Highlights
- Disorder is not a mistake; it is the default. Order is always artificial and temporary.
- The increase of disorder or entropy is what distinguishes the past from the future, giving a direction to time.
- Entropy is one of the few concepts that provide evidence for the existence of time. The “Arrow of Time” is a name given to the idea that time is asymmetrical and flows in only one direction: forward. It is a non-reversible process wherein entropy increases.
- As a student of business administration, I know that there is a law of evolution for organizations as stringent and inevitable as anything in life. The longer one exists, the more it grinds out restrictions that slow its own functions. It reaches entropy in a state of total narcissism. Only the people sufficiently far out in the field get anything done, and every time they do, they are breaking half a dozen rules in the process.

- In physics, entropy is a law; in social systems, it’s a mere tendency — though a strong one, to be sure.
- Successful businesses invest time and money to minimize entropy. For example, they provide regular staff training, good reporting of issues, inspections, detailed files, and monitoring reports of successes and failures. They ruthlessly seek out and eliminate the sediment of bureaucracy. Anything less will mean almost inevitable problems and loss of potential revenue. Without the necessary effort, a business expands into bankruptcy.
- Relationships, for example, require attention and care. If you assume your relationship is passively stable, you’ll wake up one day to divorce papers. Your house is also not passively stable. If not cleaned regularly, it will continue to get messier and messier.
