## Summary

Three years after Apple's iOS 14 update disrupted digital advertising, Meta experienced challenges due to limitations on tracking user activity for ad targeting. Brands initially reduced their Meta ad spending but have since seen stabilization and even success with Meta ads, as shown by Meta's revenue growth and improved efficiency for brands like Prose and Natural Life. Meta's investment in advertising tools like Advantage+ has been instrumental in retaining advertisers and increasing ROI, indicating that Meta remains a significant player in digital advertising despite competition from platforms like TikTok.

## Highlights
- Prior to the iOS changes, direct-to-consumer brands spent [about 35%](https://www.modernretail.co/technology/there-are-headwinds-happening-in-the-industry-inside-metas-post-ios14-strategy/) of their ad budget on Facebook. By the first quarter of 2022, that number had dropped to 27%, per Rockerbox data cited [by eMarketer.](https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/d2c-brands-2022)
