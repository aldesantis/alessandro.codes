## Summary

Placeholders are temporary things or situations we use in life, like jobs or relationships, but they can last too long and hold us back. There are three types: exploration (trying new things), convenience (easy choices), and avoidance (fear of change). It’s important to recognize and address placeholders so we live intentionally and don’t settle for less than what we truly want.

## Highlights

- And this arc — from curiosity to comfort and ultimately to avoidance — hides within it a profound emotional journey. At the last step of avoidance, we face the fear of leaving behind what’s known for the unknown. This fear, often coupled with societal expectations, can paralyze us if we let it.
- You often celebrate _placeholders of exploration_. You tend to at least notice _placeholders of convenience_ early on. But _placeholders of avoidanc_e are trickier because they involve _first noticing your emotions and acknowledging them_. And your emotions are things that you can hide even from yourself. Even once you discover them, these emotions can be hard to not suppress and to actually act upon.
