## Summary

In the glossy world of digital brands, everything sparkles—until you look too closely. Welcome to the age of Potemkin brands, where facades aren’t just for show; they’re the main attraction.

## Highlights

- Companies now, whether they sell goods or software, or perhaps even services (although maybe to a lesser extent because they require the most presence), are players in a **global theater** that requires a costume; or in other words, a uniform. The play can change quickly—at the speed of light—but _uniform-ity_ is now necessary to engage in Commerce.
- A facade acts as a shorthand, allowing entities to quickly communicate their essence in a crowded marketplace. It’s a form of cognitive efficiency, both for the sender and receiver of information.
- This awareness can also lead to a more pragmatic approach to consumption. Some consumers are prioritizing tangible value over emotional appeals—hence the rise of dupes. Other consumers find themselves attracted to smaller and local businesses.
