## Summary

MrBeast pioneered the large-scale, game show spectacle on YouTube. As he grew, tons of channels began mimicking that format – they even mimicked his open-mouthed thumbnail style!

## Highlights

- Trends are like a **pendulum**. The pendulum itself represents the culture’s collective attention and it swings from one extreme to another. As it swings closer to one end of the spectrum, it picks up speed and momentum – but it has a limit.
- Innovation happens far away from the pendulum. When you’re truly innovating, you don’t know if it will work out. All you know is that the thing you’re currently doing is NOT the current “hot” thing.
