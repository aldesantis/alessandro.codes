## Summary

Strategy and planning are not the same; strategy involves making tough choices in uncertain situations, while planning organizes actions based on already defined outcomes. Real strategy is challenging because it requires confronting uncertainty and making decisions that limit future options. If an organization focuses only on planning, it may avoid important discussions about uncertainty and risk.

## Highlights

- Strategy is the act of making difficult choices when there’s no clear answer: in other words, when there is uncertainty. These choices include choosing which of multiple outcomes to value and pursue (and which ones to devalue and ignore), diagnosing and making sense of ambiguous environments to decide how to respond to them, or deciding how to interpret different parts of the environment as either resources or constraints.
- Strategy creates the inputs for planning.
- Real strategy is both cognitively hard (like planning is) and affectively hard — it is uncomfortable and scary because confronting uncertainty is uncomfortable and scary.
