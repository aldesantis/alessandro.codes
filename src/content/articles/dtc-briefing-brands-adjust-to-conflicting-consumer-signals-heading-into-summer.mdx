## Summary

Consumer startups are facing mixed signals about spending as summer approaches. Direct-to-consumer brands are adjusting strategies to boost sales during the slower summer period. Some brands are offering targeted promotions to entice customers to make purchases now.

## Highlights
- Summer is typically a slower sales period for many brands, as it lacks a big sales event like Black Friday.
