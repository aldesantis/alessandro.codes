## Summary

I read dozens of books on the how to be more successsful, listened to hundreds of hours of podcasts, scrolled through thousands of tweets, and watched far too many videos trying to learn how to be more successful.

## Highlights
- There are ideas that fundamentally change how you see the world.
  One such idea is Rory Sutherland’s observation that the opposite of a good idea can also be a good idea.
- It’s easy to call people who care about fine wine dumb.
  But if you choose to participate in the shared hallucination, your life actually becomes richer.
  Being delusional often works in your favor.
  But so does being a hyperrealist.
  You need to be a hyperrealist and delusional.
  You need to be rational and irrational.
  You need to be intentional and follow the flow.
