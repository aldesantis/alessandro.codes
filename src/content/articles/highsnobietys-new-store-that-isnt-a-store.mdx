## Summary

Highsnobiety’s innovative approach to retail was validated when Romeo Beckham’s viral post about a unique sweater from their “Not in London” pop-up at Selfridges showcased the power of physical stores. Their upcoming flagship store in Berlin will feature a diverse range of brands and products, aiming to create a dynamic space for streetwear and fashion communities. Highsnobiety’s success with pop-ups generating revenue and brand partnerships highlights their potential for a permanent store model, offering activations and events to engage customers both online and offline. The Berlin flagship store represents a strategic move to blend physical and digital experiences in a challenging retail landscape, with plans for potential expansion to other cities if successful.

## Highlights

- “To make this a viable business opportunity we cannot simply just buy and sell product,” Highsnobiety’s founder and chief executive David Fischer said. “We want the store to be a physical space which we constantly reinvent to bring all our digital projects to life.”
- At the Berlin flagship, Highsnobiety plans to leverage its pop-up store playbook. Beyond selling products — a curated selection from brands like Our Legacy and Acne mixed with margin-boosting private label items — the space is hoped to serve as a gathering point for the city’s streetwear and fashion communities, whom the company bets big brands will pay to reach.
