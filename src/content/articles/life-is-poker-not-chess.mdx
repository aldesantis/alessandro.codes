## Summary

Life is poker, not chess.

Make decisions with incomplete information, think in probabilities, and judge choices by process, not results.

Size your bets, choose your table, and seek big upside while surviving variance.

## Highlights

- Chess assumes a controlled environment: perfect information, one opponent, predictable outcomes. Life is much messier. Life is multiple players with hidden cards, changing rules, and luck that can absolutely demolish skill in any given hand. Once you start seeing life through the poker lens, you realize most people are playing chess in a poker world. No wonder they’re frustrated when the “right” moves don’t pay off.
- On one hand, surrounding yourself with the best people makes you better. On the other hand, sometimes you need to be realistic. You’ll have to level up or find a different game.
- That’s why it’s important to figure out what you want to do earlier, even if it’s just directionally correct. Pivots are totally fine and happen all the time, but each pivot means starting the compounding clock over.
