## Summary

TikTok Shop is expected to sell about $8 billion in goods this year, but it will be banned in January, causing social commerce to decline. Users and brands may move to platforms like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels, which do not offer shopping features. The TikTok ban will disrupt the rapid growth of social commerce, which has thrived by allowing users to buy products directly after seeing them in videos.

## Highlights

- According to TabCut data, spending on TikTok Shop in the U.S. during January-November reached $6.5 billion. Full-year spending should exceed $8 billion thanks to continued holiday shopping. It got there in just over a year — TikTok Shop launched in September 2023; no sales channel has grown as quickly in the U.S. before.
- After the TikTok ban — set to take effect on January 19th — users and creators will likely migrate to platforms like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels that have replicated the core TikTok experience. TikTok’s value proposition will not disappear even if TikTok itself does.
- The $8 billion figure is not _real_; it’s only as big as TikTok boosted it to be. And it got there without onboarding recognizable brands, mostly relying on [Amazon best-sellers and Temu look-alikes.](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/tiktok-shops-first-year-in-the-us) But if it survives, there is a lot of pent-up interest from brands waiting on the sidelines.
