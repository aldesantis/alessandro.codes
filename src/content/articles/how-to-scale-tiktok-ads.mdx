## Summary

Meta’s latest algorithm update and US consumer uncertainty have teamed up to make for a challenging eCom environment in the first half of this year.

## Highlights

- • Meta and Google have the broadest access to “in market” audiences, and web behavior in general
  - For that reason, along with technical talent, they have the most accurate modeling of who is “in market”–these are the audiences who convert within seven days.
  - Their in-platform attribution maps most closely to what’s actually going on in Shopify.
