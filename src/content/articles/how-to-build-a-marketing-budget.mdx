## Summary

MER dropped from 2. 5x to 2.

## Highlights

- A lower MER at higher spend can produce more total profit, even if the efficiency looks worse on paper.
- A big part of the gap between ROAS and iROAS comes from the “halo effect” — when one channel creates demand that shows up somewhere else.
- You can evaluate each channel using:
  Optimal Spend = iROAS ÷ (Payback Period × Fragility)
