## Summary

Learning from failure can lead to personal growth and success. It’s important to stay committed and not let failure define you. Sharing your failure experiences can help normalize setbacks and empower others.

## Highlights

- Had I not let people know about my situation, even despite my initial hesitation, I would not have the job I have now. I came to realize that people want to help in any way they can. You just have to let them know.
  Don’t let failure embarrass you. Put others to work on your behalf to search for solutions, make introductions, and keep you in mind when they hear about an opportunity that might be a good fit.
