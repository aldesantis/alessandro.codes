## Summary

We spent the first years of Lomi being told all the reasons it won’t work. Chief among them?

## Highlights

- At a minimum, 85% of your market is a slow mover. They take time to make decisions, and many may never reach that point. They seek information about their problems, versus wanting to pay for a solution.
- Ideally, you want large potential markets that go with your long consideration window. A small market + long window would suck. I’d question that business model entirely.
