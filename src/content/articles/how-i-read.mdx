## Summary

Non-secrets for voracious reading

## Highlights

- “People are willing to do almost anything other than read at length…At the same time, no one relishes being ignorant or incurious…One way of squaring these opposing impulses is to give things that aren’t books the intellectual status of books.”
- If I couldn’t afford books, I’d spend much more time at the library. I’d download them from libgen. I’d physically steal them if I had to.
- “Almost every idea that you have is downstream from what you consume. When you choose who to follow on Twitter, what book to read, what podcast to listen to, you’re choosing your future thoughts.”

# How I Read

## Summary

Reading well is an endurance sport. I sometimes talk to people who want to become serious readers and so pick up Kafka’s The Trial or something like that—it is about as pleasant as running a marathon untrained.

## Highlights

- Authors I deep-read will change me to some degree; they will restructure my brain. This is a big responsibility to give someone, so I think of picking a book as a recruitment process, and I do my due diligence to make sure they are up for the job.
- If you want to reach the deepest experiences literature provides, you have to put effort into building the stamina and conceptual understanding necessary for complex writing to become transparent to you.
- Reading seriously changes your brain so that the world that comes at you grows more nuanced and interesting and filled with affordances that let you do things you didn’t know were possible. Serious reading compounds.
- Good books are compressed thoughts. They are like seeds: when you plant them in your mind, they explode from their casings and shoot up from the ground—growing much vaster than it feels reasonable a little seed like that could possibly grow.
