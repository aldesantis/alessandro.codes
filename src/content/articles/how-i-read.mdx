## Summary

Non-secrets for voracious reading

## Highlights

- “People are willing to do almost anything other than read at length…At the same time, no one relishes being ignorant or incurious…One way of squaring these opposing impulses is to give things that aren’t books the intellectual status of books.”
- If I couldn’t afford books, I’d spend much more time at the library. I’d download them from libgen. I’d physically steal them if I had to.
- “Almost every idea that you have is downstream from what you consume. When you choose who to follow on Twitter, what book to read, what podcast to listen to, you’re choosing your future thoughts.”
