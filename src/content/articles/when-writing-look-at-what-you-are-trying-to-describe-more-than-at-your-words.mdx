## Summary

When I was in my early twenties, I tried to write poems like Tomas Tranströmer. I did close readings of all his collections and reverse-engineered what he was doing.

## Highlights

- Good writing isn’t about studying how great essays or poems look and then figuring out how to reverse engineer that (though that’s part of it). Rather, it’s about learning how to pay close attention to your thoughts and feelings and the concrete materiality of the world, and mastering the craft so you can translate what you see onto the page.
