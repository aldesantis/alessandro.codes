## Summary

Product-led branding focuses on using innovative products to build a brand identity that resonates with consumers. It emphasizes the importance of product experience and storytelling over traditional advertising. By creating products that people love and use, brands can foster community and engagement.

## Highlights

- Instead of convincing people to buy something, product-led branding creates something that people want to use and identify with. It creates products that we are obsessed with.
- In product-led branding, brand identity comes from association with products in action: them being used, worn, embellished, customized, repaired, and styled, over the years, by different people and subcultures, in many different ways. The more wear stories, the richer the product narrative.
