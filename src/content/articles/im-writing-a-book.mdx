## Summary

Rosie Spinks is writing a book called How To Build a Village about restoring in-person care and community.

It took years, failed proposals, and the support of her readers to land deals in the US and UK.

She’ll slow the newsletter while finishing the draft, share updates with subscribers, and is grateful for the help.

## Highlights

- Taking care of other people — the friction, the repetition, the cost, and the surprising rewards of it — is strategically buried by our economy and value system.
