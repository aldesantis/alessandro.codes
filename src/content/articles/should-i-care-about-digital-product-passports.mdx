## Summary

Digital Product Passports (DPP) are gaining attention in the fashion industry, promoting transparency and sustainability. While larger brands may need to prioritize compliance with upcoming EU legislation, smaller companies might not face immediate enforcement. Brands that invest in transparency now could gain a competitive edge in an increasingly informed market.

## Highlights

- DPP is part of a wider legislative framework from the EU commission - Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR). It aims to improve circularity, energy performance and other sustainability aspects of products being sold in the Eurozone.
- The Digital Product Passport (DPP) will hold data from throughout the value chain of a product, including Product, Material, Asset and Event data.
- A digital record (or _digital twin_) is connected to the physical product via unique identifier - QR code, NFC, RFID or other data carrier - allowing consumers, authorities and other stakeholders to access detailed information on the product.
