## Summary

The document discusses the concept of using practice as a bar for truth rather than relying solely on analysis. It contrasts the effectiveness of deliberate practice in various domains and highlights the practical limitations of scientific ideas like growth mindset when applied. The author emphasizes the importance of personal experience and practical application in determining what works effectively, suggesting that epistemic rigor alone is not enough without real-world testing. The narrative underscores the value of implementing ideas and techniques in practice to evaluate their true impact, rather than engaging in purely theoretical discussions.

## Highlights

- What makes a thing useful for you is if you have tried it out in your life and, err, _you’ve found it to be useful_. That’s it! It’s a simple bar. You don’t have to worry about replications over larger sample sizes (though this should increase your confidence in a method) — if it works for you, it works for you.
- Pragmatism considers words and thought as tools and instruments for prediction, problem solving, and action, and rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality. Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics—such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science—are all best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes.
