## Summary

This document is a preparation guide for weightlifting, consisting of four tasks. The first task is to take body photos and measure grip strength, which is essential for progress in heavier lifting. The second task is to purchase workout equipment, including whey or rice protein, which provides the necessary protein to gain muscle. The third task is to take workout supplements, such as creatine, which has been shown to double the speed of strength gains. The fourth and final task is to learn proper protein servings and timing. These tasks aim to ease individuals into lifestyle changes and make them less likely to quit.
