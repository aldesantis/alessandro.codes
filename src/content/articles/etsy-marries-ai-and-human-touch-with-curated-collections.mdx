## Summary

Etsy has launched curated collections that combine AI and human input to create personalized shopping experiences based on user preferences and trends. The new feature uses machine learning to expand expert-curated selections and ensure quality and aesthetic coherence. This approach aims to provide customers with more gift ideas and inspiration, enhancing their overall shopping experience.

## Highlights

- “I think the real secret is leveraging LLM’s at the end to be able to then ask it to make sure there’s cohesion across the collection,” Daniel said. Etsy asks AI to decipher if items fit in a given collection to “ensure that we haven’t just algorithmically extended the seed collection, but we’ve done it in a way that still has that human touch.”
