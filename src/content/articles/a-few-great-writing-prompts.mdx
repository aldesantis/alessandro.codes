## Summary

By writing about something you want to learn about, you’re forced to do the research necessary to solidify your OWN understanding.

## Highlights

- **What do I want to remember?**
  Your desire to remember something is a good sign that this is worth sharing. Plus, memorization comes from repetition. So if you want to remember something, spending more time repeatedly thinking about that thing will help.
- **What is interesting to me right now?**
  When you’re at the edge of some industry, the things that YOU are interested in will be new to others as well. People will look to YOU as someone who can tell them what they should be interested in right now. Be a tastemaker!

- **What has someone asked me that I didn’t have a great answer to?**
  When someone asks you a question, it’s because they both 1.) respect your opinion and 2.) expect you’ll have an answer. When you DON’T have a great answer to a question you’ve been asked, it’s a sign that this may be a new, poorly understood area.
