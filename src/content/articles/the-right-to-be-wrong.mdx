## Summary

The author warns against harsh “gotcha” culture that punishes public mistakes and kills curiosity. Important questions about creativity, ownership, and the future of the internet keep returning, even as trends change. We must allow room for exploration and error to keep learning and growing together.

## Highlights

- Packaging fails. Questions survive. They find new homes.
- When something crashes, we assume the whole thing was wrong, dumb, a waste of time. We don’t separate the implementation from the question. We don’t notice when it resurfaces somewhere else, rebuilt by people who learned from what didn’t work the first time around.
- We got good at the gotcha. So good that somewhere along the way we stopped being able to tell the difference between someone acting in bad faith and someone just getting it wrong.
