## Summary

Digital luxury experiences are evolving, but many still struggle to match the allure of physical luxury. Brands are exploring new dimensions like innovation, participation, and ephemerality to create truly unique digital luxury experiences. The future of luxury lies in blending technology and cultural context to create digital experiences that rival great art.

## Highlights

- *A luxury experience…is based on the orchestration of rare or beautiful (or both) ingredients that address at least one or more of the human senses in a way that enables the enactment of a specific creative train of thought.
  The individual who perceives the luxury experiences may be physically, emotionally, or intellectually impacted.*‍
