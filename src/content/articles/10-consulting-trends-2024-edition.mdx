## Summary

The "10 Consulting Trends: 2024 Edition" provides insights on trends in the consulting industry, focusing on mid-sized consultancies. Economic uncertainty has impacted consultancies since late 2022, leading to challenges like reduced client budgets and project indecisiveness. To navigate the evolving landscape, consultancies are urged to deepen client relationships, prioritize thought leadership content, and focus on education-driven marketing to attract and retain clients. Consultancies are advised to enhance their digital presence, differentiate through positioning, and streamline service offerings to address client needs effectively in 2024.

## Highlights
- **Consultancies that strive to deepen existing client relationships tend to have stronger financial stability**. My consultancy clients were more keen than ever to forge closer relationships with their existing clients. This included regular check-ins, feedback sessions, educational interventions, open round table discussions, private webinars on hot topics (e.g. market trends, new tech), co-creating upcoming projects, and a pro-active client success program.

- **Service design should accommodate deeper relationships with clients**. There are many ways to extend a consultancy’s services to extend the engagement with clients and increase the value provided to them. For example, ongoing adoption monitoring, introducing subscription-based support models, vertical service integration, implementing managed services, strategic CXO guidance, platform or programmatic delivery (automation, monitoring, analysis,...), scheduled service reviews, ongoing data analysis & reporting, or budget planning support.
- **Consultancy leaders could consider redefining client engagement entry points**. I've assisted in several service entry-point redesigns to lower the decision-making bar for new clients. Here are some examples: developing (self) assessment tools for better initial engagement, the development of paid discovery services (e.g. feasibility study), simplification of client onboarding processes, or breaking down large projects into smaller, manageable parts to ease client decision-making.
- • 73% of executives say they **will look at competitors** if their advisory company is not producing thought leadership content
  • 60% of executives report increased **demand for thought leadership content** to support their business.
  • 50% attest to the **critical importance of such content in their decision-making process** when selecting an advisor.
- According to Grist’s study:
  • 51% want action-oriented content that helps make more informed decisions
  • 50% want content that shows fresh thinking and explores new or different perspectives
  • 48% want authentic content that puts existing expertise into practice.

- **I urge consultancy leaders to rethink their approach to LinkedIn**. 95% of consultancy owners have nothing to say. Their LinkedIn is ‘empty’. Growing a consultancy business is rooted in educating the target audience. And for those consultancy owners and leaders who think they can get away with doing a few quick and dirty chatGPT posts – welcome to the noise! This type of content will never accomplish meaningful results.
- **It’s time to stop appointing partners without a voice**. A silent majority is rising to power, a cohort of newly appointed partners who, perplexingly, have no discernible voice in their market. Their LinkedIn profiles are eerily quiet, their expertise domains, if detectable, are not connected to any leading voice, and their authority seems invisible to the naked eye.
- I believe that marketing in a consulting business should be circular. Blog posts on the consultancy’s page can be broken down into smaller pieces of actionable advice on LinkedIn. The response rate and engagements on LinkedIn can be used to inform the thought leader and marketers what resonates with the target audience and why. This is then used to dive deeper into certain topics.
- I encourage consultancies to also incorporate sharing expertise through guest posts and guest appearances at online and offline events (e.g., podcasts) into the marketing strategy. Feedback from those guest engagements can then be utilized for future content.
- **I strongly encourage consultancy owners and leaders to engage in conversations with the target audience and set up feedback loops**. So much marketing that I come across from my clients and my target audience, in general, feels stale. There is no conversation. No valuable engagement. One of the main reasons I love LinkedIn so much is that, for me, it’s a live conference room. I use it to be constantly plugged into the conversation within my niche. I source feedback, I engage with the posts of others, and I incorporate feedback into my content strategy.
- **Marketing efforts are enhanced with a value-driven email strategy**. Despite all sorts of new marketing channels popping up over the years, email remains unchallenged in its effectiveness. Even in 2024. Not only is email cost-effective, but it’s the ultimate trust weapon for consultancies. When a prospect reads a piece of thought leadership content and feels compelled to sign up for the newsletter, that’s a massive green flag that consultancies should pay attention to.
- Value proposition design is one of the most crucial aspects of establishing the growth parameters of a consultancy. It impacts everything: how the consultancy is perceived in the market, how it pitches its services, how it is managed internally, what types of clients it takes on, and what kind of prospects to confidently say no to. It’s a compass that consultancy owners use in their decision-making.
