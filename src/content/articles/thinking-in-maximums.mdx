## Summary

The article “Thinking in Maximums” argues that startups should focus on bold, ambitious goals rather than small, incremental changes. It highlights successful companies like OpenAI and Tesla, which embraced big thinking to drive innovation and create lasting impact. By prioritizing long-term visions, these companies demonstrate that significant progress often requires commitment and a willingness to take risks.

## Highlights

- Researchers at Bell Labs or DARPA weren’t obsessing over how quickly they could produce a minimum product. They were exploring fundamental science, building the backbone for entire industries that blossomed decades later. We have lost some of that culture in the mania for small, immediate wins. Maximum thinking demands a willingness to sustain ideas over a long horizon.
