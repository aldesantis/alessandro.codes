## Summary

I interviewed Keith Nieves, the Social Media Program Lead at Sonos, about how he has built goodwill during such a tough time for the brand.

## Highlights

- When representing a brand, being authentic and genuine needs to be at the top of the order. We build relationships in social media, and that requires things like fearless transparency and an organic human touch. Don’t act in service of the brand, be in service of the community member.
- To that point, again, be real and a member of the community first. There are recurring jokes, certain users that frequent the space, etc. You need to be in tune with the community, before you can offer something they may be lacking—product education, insight, etc.
