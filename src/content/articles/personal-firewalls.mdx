## Summary

The author discusses the overwhelming number of online notifications and messages that consume our attention. They predict a cultural shift towards “ping minimalism,” where people will reclaim their time by setting boundaries and limiting access to their attention. This change will lead to new tools and norms for managing digital communication and improving focus.

## Highlights

- _To be available is to be open to great possibility, but at the risk of great exploitation_ — not necessarily by individual people but rather by attention-grabbing machines that are smarter than us at laser-focusing on achieving their goals.
- Humans learn by doing, then overdoing, then realizing they screwed up, and then self-correcting, and then usually overcorrecting.
