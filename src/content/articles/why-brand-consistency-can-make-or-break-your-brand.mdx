## Summary

Brand consistency is crucial for building a strong brand identity and fostering loyalty. Maintaining consistency in all aspects of your brand experience helps in capturing attention and emotional connection. It involves replicating actions and behaviors without deviation to convey a clear and recognizable brand message.

## Highlights

- On a human level, this might be because the people who work in agencies have a strong, instinctive desire to create change. Change is also on the menu because it’s mandated in the briefs they receive – brand and marketing teams express a desire for change and agencies are very happy to oblige
- Brands are results, established in the mind, built over time. Repeated actions create strong patterns and people’s minds like patterns. The clearer the pattern, the more identifiable the brand.
