## Summary

In 2024, many consumer packaged goods (CPG) startups faced shutdowns due to high costs, inflation, and intense competition. While some brands thrived, others struggled to scale effectively and manage expenses, leading to closures. Experts believe that only the most efficient and innovative brands will survive in this challenging environment.

## Highlights

- “That strategy backfired for several of the companies that we’ve worked with,” Truesdell said. Oftentimes, Truesdell said these moves are last ditch efforts to go after a big new channel without not having the dollars to invest in growing it. On the other hand, Truesdell said, “I think that brands that got scrappy and creative, and didn’t let the doom-and-gloom get them, benefitted.”
- “There has been an over-reliance on ‘growth at all costs,” Gilbreath said. “Meanwhile, cash flow constraints also became a significant issue as costs rose.”
- “The barrier to entry to building a CPG brand is relatively low — which means that many CPG startup founders come in without much of an understanding of the costs necessary to scale and a lack of understanding of which products are actually suitable for retail,” Grace explained.
- Part of adapting requires making difficult decisions when at a crossroads. For instance, while it’s difficult pulling out of a milestone channel, like a big-box retailer, Truesdell has advised brands to cut these partners without hesitation if they aren’t working.
