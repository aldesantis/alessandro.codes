## Summary

Founder-led beauty brands often grow slowly and must focus beyond the founder’s fame to succeed. Consumers care most about product quality, price, and how well the brand meets their needs. Brands do best when they build a strong identity and clear values that connect with shoppers emotionally.

Brands that rely too heavily on the visibility of their founders may struggle to sustain momentum — especially in a market where attention is constantly shifting and consumer loyalty must be earned, particularly through strong product performance.
