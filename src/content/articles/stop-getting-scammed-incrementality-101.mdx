## Summary

A lot of digital marketing “best practices” around measurement muddy the waters of incrementality.

## Highlights

- The best way to measure marketing incrementality is a holdout test:
  ​
  You split your target population in half. One half of the population receives your marketing campaign (the test group). The other half does not (the holdout group). Other than the marketing campaign, both populations are treated exactly the same.
  ​
  You measure the conversions and spend from the test and holdout groups. If the test group spends more, or converts at a higher rate, and that lift in sales/conversions is [statistically significant](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/0vu2me52mzi9ho35vx2flhw99g855tn/l2hehmh32dd0vgi6/aHR0cHM6Ly9zdGF0aXN0aWNzYnlqaW0uY29tL2h5cG90aGVzaXMtdGVzdGluZy9zdGF0aXN0aWNhbC1zaWduaWZpY2FuY2Uv), your marketing “worked”.
- Conversion campaigns that explicitly exclude existing customers are usually quite incremental _unless_ your brand has built up a lot of awareness outside of Meta.
- ASC campaigns don’t allow you to exclude customer lists explicitly; instead, you set an “existing customer targeting cap”. ASC campaigns tend to target more existing customers than “traditional” campaigns.
- Explicitly targeting your own customers might drive incremental spend from that audience, but the upside is limited relative to customer acquisition and should be measured carefully.
