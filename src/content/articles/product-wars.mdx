## Summary

How apparel's two opposing forces - identity and functionality - are shaping its strategy

## Highlights
- Identity is born out of use, and it is only by first being worn in different cultural contexts that these now-iconic products became symbols.
- Fun brands donâ€™t sell more products. Good products sell more products.
- Brand identity comes from association with products that are worn, repeatedly and over years, by different people and subcultures, in many different ways. A brand is a matter of product use and time.
