## Summary

Personalized marketing, while valuable for some, generates negative experiences for 53% of customers, who were 3.2x more likely to regret a purchase and 44% less likely to purchase again in the future, according to a survey by Gartner, Inc.

## Highlights

- According to the research, course-changing personalization significantly outperforms traditional “next best action” recommendations for customers in pitfalls. Active personalization empowers individuals to reflect, build confidence, and take decisive actions aligned with their authentic goals.
