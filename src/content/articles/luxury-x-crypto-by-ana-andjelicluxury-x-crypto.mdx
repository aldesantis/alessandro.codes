Luxury x Crypto

## Summary

How to win in a simulation

## Highlights
- Most valuable assets are those that combine physical and digital benefits: e.g. a Gucci jacket has both the use value and exchange value thanks to being associated with a digital collectible.

- Capsules and special collections come with selling ownership rights of individual products via crypto. If one buys a token attached to a product in a collection, they will receive royalties from the product sales down the line.
- Authentication - “product passports” - provided by tokens ensures that resold items are not counterfeits. This opens up another marketplace for luxury brands, where they can resell their own pre-owned items.
- Turning a brand into a platform where the role of the artistic director is to create a brand’s aesthetic universe, and where creativity is not limited only to the members of the design team. Designs come from a wide array of creators and the brand collects a fee from the sale of their designs under its umbrella.

- Digital assets have high margins. Minting them (while it has a high environmental cost) does not require physical materials, production facilities and massive costs of time and labor in order to be created. This expands a brand’s market and reduces its supply and production costs: a selected limited number of items can be produced in the physical world and the rest can be created virtually and used for consumer status-signaling.

- Having a metaverse link allows a brand to cultivate “elitism to all:” it can sell a lot of digital asset-accompanied items to a lot of people without diluting a brand’s symbolic value.
- Crypto moves the money to the people who create and the people who consume, and to the people who improve the network itself. This means that influencers can keep earning money off their styles in perpetuity, through royalty fees paid by the brands featured in their looks.

- Crypto has the opportunity to make brand loyalty programs more relevant, meaningful and valuable to its members by rewarding individual and community contributions, providing fractionalized ownership, culturally enriching members’ lives through access and offering signaling of status, social distinction and belonging.
