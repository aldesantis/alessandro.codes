## Summary

Rather than attempting to persuade us (via our rational, analytical minds), ads prey on our emotions.

## Highlights
- Social scientists have a tool that they use to reason about phenomena like this: *Homo economicus*. This is an idealized model of human behavior, a hypothetical creature (/caricature) who makes perfectly "rational" decisions, where "rational" is a well-defined game-theoretic concept meaning (roughly) self-interested and utility-maximizing.

- First, a lot of ads work simply by *raising awareness*. These ads are essentially telling customers, "FYI, product X exists. Here's how it works. It's available if you need it."
- Perhaps the most important mechanism used by ads (across the ages) is *making promises*. These promises can be explicit, in the form of a guarantee or warrantee, but are more often implicit, in the form of a brand image.

- There's one more honest ad mechanism to discuss. This one is termed (appropriately) *honest signaling*, and it's an instance of Marshall McLuhan's famous dictum, "The medium is the message." Here an ad conveys valuable information *simply by existing* — or more specifically, by existing in a very expensive location.

- The same way an engagement ring is an honest token of a man's commitment to his future spouse, an expensive ad campaign is an honest token of a company's commitment to its product line.

- Cultural imprinting is the mechanism whereby an ad, rather than trying to change our minds individually, instead changes the *landscape of cultural meanings* — which in turn changes *how we are perceived by others* when we use a product.

- In this way, cultural imprinting relies on the principle of **common knowledge**. For a fact to be [common knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_knowledge_(logic)) among a group, it's not enough for everyone to know it. Everyone must also know *that everyone else knows it* — and know that they know that they know it... and so on.
- The key differentiating factor between the two mechanisms (inception and imprinting) is how *conspicuous* the ad needs to be. Insofar as an ad works by inception, its effect takes place entirely between the ad and an individual viewer; the ad doesn't need to be conspicuous at all. On the other hand, for an ad to work by cultural imprinting, it needs to be placed in a conspicuous location, where viewers will see it *and* know that others are seeing it too.

- So if an ad works by inception, we should expect the value (to the advertiser) to scale *linearly* with the size of the audience. On the other hand, if an ad works by cultural imprinting, we should expect its value (to the advertiser) to scale *more than linearly* with the size of the audience.

- Ads get us to buy things not in spite of our rationality, but *because* of it. Ads target us not as *Homo sapiens*, full of idiosyncratic quirks, but as utility-maximizing *Homo economicus*.
