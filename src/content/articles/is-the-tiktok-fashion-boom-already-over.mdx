## Summary

Lawmakers in the US introduced a bill that could force ByteDance, the China-based parent company of TikTok, to divest the app within six months to avoid a ban. TikTok has faced threats before, but this time, the bill has bipartisan support and is advancing quickly in the House. While TikTok has grown in popularity and impacted the fashion industry, its recent foray into e-commerce with TikTok Shop has faced challenges and user backlash, potentially affecting its future success. Despite concerns and potential decline in user growth, TikTok remains a significant platform for brands and influencers, navigating changes and criticisms similar to those experienced by other social media platforms like Instagram.

## Highlights

- That doesn’t mean the app can’t sell products. TikTok clearly has a knack for combining social media and commerce in a way its competitors could never figure out. It just needs to make the experience feel more natural by toning down the number of shopping videos that appear in the feed, and giving users a sense they have a choice whether to use TikTok for shopping or entertainment.
