## Summary

Self-employment challenges you to confront your fears about money and financial security. Unlike full-time employees, self-employed individuals must develop a clear understanding of their finances due to unpredictable income. Instead of focusing solely on making more money, it’s crucial to find happiness and fulfillment in life now, rather than postponing it for retirement.

## Highlights

- One of the surprising things of self-employment is that it forces you to [face your money fears](https://think-boundless.com/fear-setting-exercise/) immediately and because of the unpredictable nature of income flows over time, forces you to develop a working mental model of how to think about money. This is in contrast to many full-time employees who because of steady income flows can put off ever having a coherent framework for thinking about money as long as they stay employed.
- Financial insecurity seems to be a proxy for all sorts of insecurities including a general fear of death, the general anxiety of rising costs of the modern world and feeling like you’ll run out of money, and not feeling like you are good enough.
- people’s expectations of what they need are built on their current lifestyle and if you have head steadily increasing salaries and expenses you will assume it is only possible to live and be happy in such an arrangement
- The current paradigm of work seems to suggest that one should suffer for a long stretch of time working full-time and then at a certain age let out a deep breath and head somewhere warm to retire and spend time with other retired people.
  I am quite sure I don’t want this because I am not interested in a life of leisure, at least how people think about it now. I’m much more interested in the historical definition of [leisure](https://think-boundless.com/leisure/), one that centered around contemplation and active engagement with the world.
- The bigger challenge with this in mind is what I aim towards instead of a traditional retirement? The simple answer is that I’m not aiming towards anything. I’m trying to be fully alive today.
