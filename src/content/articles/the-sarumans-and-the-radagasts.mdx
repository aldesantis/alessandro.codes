## Summary

The text discusses two archetypes of power: Sarumans and Radagasts. Sarumans are bold, self-interested individuals who believe they make the world go round, while Radagasts inspire and uplift others, creating a collective magic. Both archetypes have unique strengths and weaknesses, with Gandalf representing a balance between the two.

## Highlights
- Luck only exists when looking into the uncertain and cloudy future; in the bright light of the past there is always an obvious-in-retrospect, plausibly-causal story to tell yourself or others.
- A Saruman is somene who believes they are a Great Man of history, and has enough initial success that others come to believe it, too. This belief can then self-strengthen and grow to dizzying heights.
- When we believe something, the actions we take makes it so in the world, just a little bit. Those beliefs and actions don’t just affect us but everyone around us, influencing *their* actions and beliefs, just a little bit. These beliefs are interdependent and compound. The more that people believe, the more likely it becomes for the marginal person to believe, too, in a self-accelerating gravity well of belief. If enough people believe, then in some fundamental sense, it becomes real. Of course, everything still has to be compatible with the ground truth of physical reality to stay long-term viable; but the tops of these belief towers can stretch very far from the ground truth and create conditions that to a physicist would look like magic.
- Radagasts love the variation and diversity and know that if you reflect that love differentially, putting just a *bit* more energy into the parts that just so happen to align with your goals, you can achieve great things.
- Radagasts create immense amounts of indirect and diffuse value. But value is significantly easier to extract when it is centralized. That means that Radagasts are unable to harvest significant financial returns from that value they create — not that they would necessarily want to. No Radagast owns their own helicopter. Radagasts do it for its own sake, playing an infinite game, not a finite one. You can do true alchemy… as long as you never get rewarded for it.
- Radagasts are people who understand that if you are captured entirely within a specific machine you will not be able to change it but will instead by changed *by* it. Likewise, they understand that trying to change a machine from outside will fail because the machine will continuously reject interventions that are not in harmony with its current emergent workings. The only way to change a machine is to have one foot inside and one foot outside; a position to do situated leverage.
- Holding your goal at arm’s length, seeing it almost as a game and disconnecting it from your ego, allows you the space to execute clever judo moves with less fear of failure.
- Radagasts don’t have self doubt but for a totally different reason: because they don’t hold tightly to any particular outcome. They just try to live authentically, so there’s nothing to doubt. “Am I living each moment in a way I’m proud of?” is all that matters.
- The archetype of this active balancing, between the power and vision of Saruman, and the playful, compassionate, and organicness of Radagast, is Gandalf.
