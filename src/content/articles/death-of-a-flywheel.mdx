## Summary

How Amazon and Berkshire got too big

## Highlights

- While the scale is unprecedented, this is something all companies face at some point in their existence. I call it the _scaled out problem:_ growth plateaus for a particular business line as the marginal cost to acquire additional customers outstrips their lifetime value. Companies have to diversify their markets and/or product mix. If they don’t, they embrace a slow death by decay.

- Think of it this way: A company is powered by a flywheel, but the longer that flywheel spins, the less efficient the motion. Eventually the sand gets in the gears, and each additional unit of speed is harder to gain, and you have to add new flywheels to get the machine moving again.

- A gross oversimplification of a company’s life cycle would be [something like this](https://every.to/napkin-math/how-technology-giants-die):
  1. A company makes a successful product that gets it stupid rich.
  2. The company builds or acquires nearby opportunities with excess cash as its core market’s growth starts to run out.
  3. Repeat ad nauseum, spreading the company further and further afield.
  4. Eventually, the company is holding a grab bag of uncorrelated assets that underperform.

- All the strategy books imploring operators to build “synergies” are telling you to do so only because those synergies make it easier for the assets to be successful. For example, In Amazon’s retail business, the uniting force would be Amazon Prime.

- The closer you get to the questions of being a hedge fund, the more statistically unlikely it is for a company to outperform the S&P 500.

- However, top performers and executives usually have very little interest in protecting an asset. Usually CEOs want to aggressively grow a company so they can increase their comp and prestige.
