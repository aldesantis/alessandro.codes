## Summary

Gartner predicts that AI agents will significantly change the workplace, but there is growing disillusionment as many expectations are not being met. While enterprises recognize AI’s potential, they face challenges like high costs, talent shortages, and the need for better reliability. Despite these hurdles, a majority of CEOs believe AI will be crucial for their industries in the future.

## Highlights

- [Open-source AI](https://venturebeat.com/ai/enterprise-ai-adoption-surges-as-organizations-shift-from-experimentation-to-implementation/) is also on the rise. Chandrasekaran pointed out that the market has so far been dominated by closed-source models, but open source provides customization and deployment flexibility — models can run in the cloud, on-prem, at the edge or on mobile devices.
- Finally, edge AI is coming to the fore. Much smaller models — between 1B to 10B parameters — will be used for resource-constrained environments. These can run on PCs or mobile devices, providing for “acceptable and reasonable accuracy,” said Chandrasekaran.
