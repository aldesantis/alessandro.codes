## Summary

E-commerce is a crucial sales channel for B2B companies, with two-thirds of corporate buyers relying on digital and remote channels throughout the buying journey. In-person selling is no longer the most effective channel, with e-commerce accounting for more than 18% of revenue for the average B2B company. Misconceptions exist that need to be dispelled, including the notion that customers aren’t ready for e-commerce and that e-commerce is an immature space for businesses. B2B companies are treating e-commerce as a full-service channel and investing accordingly, with digital marketplaces becoming an important part of the purchasing mix.

## Highlights

- Two-thirds of corporate customers intentionally reach for digital or remote in-person engagement when given a choice. Moreover, they’re doing so at _every_ stage of the purchasing journey. In all, e-commerce has surpassed in-person as the single most effective channel (Exhibit 3).

- More than one-third (35 percent) now say they are willing to spend $500,000 or more in a single transaction on digital channels, a figure that has grown steadily over the past 12 months, and a whopping 15 percent of corporate decision makers are comfortable making purchases worth more than $1 million online (Exhibit 5).
