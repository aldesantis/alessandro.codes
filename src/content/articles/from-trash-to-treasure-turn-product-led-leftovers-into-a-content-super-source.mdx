## Summary

Product-Led Growth (PLG) often leads to valuable by-products being wasted in digital archives. Instead of focusing solely on traditional product-led content, marketers should utilize these by-products to create original content that aligns with the product’s value proposition. By-products such as data from product analytics, quotes from user interviews, and industry insights can be transformed into various content types, reducing production costs and increasing originality and authenticity. The document provides tips on using product data, in-house expertise and opinion, and the company’s journey to cultivate brand authority, attract customers, and nurture loyalty. Marketers are encouraged to explore the hidden gems within their organizations and turn them into valuable narratives.

## Highlights

- If your content has no point of view (or adds nothing new to the conversation), then people have no reason to engage with you. Present opinions, back them up, and invite a discussion.
