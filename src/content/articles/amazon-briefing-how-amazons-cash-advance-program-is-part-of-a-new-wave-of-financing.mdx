## Summary

Amazon is expanding a new cash advance service for sellers next year, part of a growing crop of short-term financial services catering to e-commerce businesses amid a drop in venture spending.

## Highlights
- Investment sector analysts at CB Insights found that global venture funding in the third quarter [dropped to $74.5 billion](https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_Venture-Report-Q3-2022.pdf), a nine-quarter low and a 34% drop from the previous quarter. Overall activity is also down from the flurry of pandemic-era: the number of deals hit 7,936, the lowest level since 2020.
- McCabe from SMB said that cash advances may not be the right fit for all business, especially if they become more expensive based on how the repayment terms are set up. In the case of the Amazon and Shopify cash advance services, the repayment rate is dependent upon the business’s individual risk profile.
