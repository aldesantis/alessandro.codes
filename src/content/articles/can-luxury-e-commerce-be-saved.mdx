## Summary

Luxury e-commerce platforms, including Farfetch and Matches, have faced financial challenges during the pandemic. Farfetch secured emergency funding from Coupang, a South Korean e-commerce company, while Frasers Group acquired Matches for a fraction of its previous valuation. The fate of Yoox Net-a-Porter remains uncertain. To survive, luxury e-tailers need to find paths to profitable growth that do not rely solely on digital advertising and discounting. Personalized shopping experiences and strategic partnerships may be key for their success. The future of online luxury e-commerce remains uncertain as companies navigate these challenges.

## Highlights

- To survive, luxury e-tailers need to map out paths to profitable growth without relying on digital ad blitzes and discounting. Investing in creating personalised shopping experiences to increase loyalty and lessen the need to constantly chase new customers is an obvious starting point.
- The closest might be Mytheresa. The Munich-based company leverages customer data generated on its platform to identify and hook customers who are willing to spend big —and repeatedly. Mytheresa is also known for staging immersive real-world events for high rollers. The site generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of €41 million in its fiscal year ending June 2023.
