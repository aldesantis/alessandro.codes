## Summary

Progress is not automatic. Many people continue doing the same things without significant growth. To achieve big results, radical changes are often necessary.

## Highlights

- You can’t just keep doing the exact same thing and expect wildly different outcomes.
  More of same will not unlock the next level.
  This may seem obvious but it really isn’t.
