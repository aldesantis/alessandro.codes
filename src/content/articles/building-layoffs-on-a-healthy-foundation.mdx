## Summary

The text discusses the challenges and considerations involved in conducting layoffs within a company, emphasizing the importance of strategic planning, clear communication, and managing the emotional impact on employees. It highlights the need for leaders to approach layoffs thoughtfully, with a focus on maintaining transparency, minimizing disruption to operations, and prioritizing the well-being of both departing and remaining staff. The text also stresses the significance of preparing for layoffs in advance, implementing structured processes, and addressing the organizational and emotional repercussions that come with such decisions.

## Highlights

- The first and most important motivation for secrecy is during the planning phase you don’t know the details sufficiently to answer anyone’s questions. In the absence of answers people will fill in the gaps with their fears. Those fears can make the process more difficult and also can cause permanent ruptures in some people’s equanimity in relationship to the company.
- Make sure your teams have a good understanding of how the business works. Besides being important to build a good product engineering culture, a team that understands how the business works (or what the hypothesis is about how the business will work) will find it easier to understand why layoffs may make sense for the business. If by contrast your culture is focused exclusively on a life of mind uncluttered by commercial concerns a layoff will feel like a betrayal.
- • Know your ratios. What is your target EPD ratio? EPD to Sales, Marketing and HR? What is your target manager to IC ratio? What is your target senior to early career ratios? Having opinions about these things before you’re in right in the middle of a layoff will make planning much smoother. It also means that you can examine whether your ratios are the right ones as part of the layoff planning.
- Layoffs should not be used as a substitute for actively managing out folks who aren’t working out.
- Relatedly make sure your most important folks know they’re important, feel appreciated and are excited about the future before you’re in the middle of navigating the delicate balance of being excited about the future while respectful of the people who are leaving.
