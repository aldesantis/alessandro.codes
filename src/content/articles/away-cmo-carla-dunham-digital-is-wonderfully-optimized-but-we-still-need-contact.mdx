## Summary

When Carla Dunham joined the luggage brand Away as its CMO in January 2023, the focus became expanding the DTC brand’s marketing efforts through an on-the-pulse strategy. Leveraging Dunham’s marketing experience spanning Foxtrot, Equinox, Kate Spade and Amazon, Away is now tapping into new audiences. The focus for the brand’s marketing has shifted to using TV strategies, testing AI-integrated marketing and expanding the U.S. retail footprint.

## Highlights

- With our Zone One customer insights group, we do everything from one-on-one focus group-type interactions to ongoing surveys that allow us to really pulse-check with them. And it’s not just about the product. It’s also asking: What do they think of our advertising? What do they think of how our website is doing? Are we offering up the right type of assortment as efficiently as possible?
