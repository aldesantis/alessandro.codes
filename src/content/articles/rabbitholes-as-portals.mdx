## Summary

Going down rabbitholes means following your curiosity deeply, which can lead to valuable knowledge and passion. Some rabbitholes are traps that waste time, while others are portals to meaningful learning and growth. To find the right rabbitholes, explore many freely and look for ones that keep you motivated and engaged over time.

## Highlights

- Rabbithole knowledge is the hyperspecific stuff you learn about a particular subject without any obvious need to know it. It’s not related to your field of study. It’s not related to a degree you’re seeking. It’s not related to a job you have. It’s not related to a person you’re trying to impress. Rabbithole knowledge is just the result of a strong gravitational pull of curiosity that can’t easily be explained.
- On the other hand, some rabbitholes can be _portals_. Portals to worlds that open up even more avenues for _your_ natural curiosity. Portals to adjacent rabbitholes that form a network of related topics that make up a bigger domain of knowledge _that you care about_.
- Going down rabbitholes does hide a subtle danger. There’s a tradeoff between breadth and depth. Innately curious people risk loving the _fall_ more than what’s at the _bottom_ of the rabbithole.
