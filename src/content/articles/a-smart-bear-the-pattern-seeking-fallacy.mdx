## Summary

The "Pattern-Seeker" fallacy refers to humans' tendency to perceive patterns in randomness. This phenomenon can lead to faulty conclusions in data analysis and marketing. The solution is to form a hypothesis and intentionally test it, rather than combing through data until a pattern emerges. This approach will lead to more accurate insights and discoveries.

## Highlights
- But suppose I did a “10-flip trial” one thousand times. A fair coin should still come up heads 3-7 times in each trial, but every once in a while it will come up 9 or 10 times. **Those events are rare, but I’m flipping so much that rare events will naturally occur.** In fact, in 1000 trials there’s a 62% chance that I’ll see 10 heads at least once.
