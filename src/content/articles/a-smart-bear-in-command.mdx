## Summary

Being “in control” is impossible, perhaps not even desirable. Being “in command” is ideal: honest, introspective, agile, aware, and proactive.

## Highlights

- Being “in command” doesn’t mean you’re constantly telling people what to do. It means you’re acting as an editor, not a writer, unless being a writer is necessary to make progress. And if _that_ is happening constantly, that you make a change on the team so that it’s _not_ happening constantly.
