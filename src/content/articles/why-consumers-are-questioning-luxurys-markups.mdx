## Summary

Luxury brands like Dior and Armani are facing scrutiny for high markups and poor factory conditions, with reports of low production costs for expensive items. Consumers are increasingly disappointed as they perceive a decline in quality and are questioning what they are really paying for. Experts suggest that growing awareness may push the industry towards more transparency and ethical practices.

## Highlights
- “Some people buy luxury clothes to feel some sense of ownership and authorship in a chaotic world over what they own and what symbols they can wield for power and control,” adds fashion theorist Rian Phin. “Some people feel compelled by brand storytelling, and I believe everyone buys into luxury because they have an understanding of the cultural power and status — including just wanting to look like a put-together person in their clothes, and the idea of leisure attached to that.”
