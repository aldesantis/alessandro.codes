## Summary

The author prefers simple, straightforward plans over complex ones that require advanced knowledge and training. They value plans that are easy to execute, understand, and evaluate without the need for extensive research or luck. The focus is on practicality, clear goals, and alignment within the team for successful execution.

## Highlights

- I like plans where the value is obvious. Build another product that our existing customers would like to buy. Save $100,000. Make it way easier to get started using our product. I don’t like plans where the goals are abstract – take a strategic position in the market, explore new buyers, showcase our AI strategy.
- I like plans that don’t require getting lucky. I like doing stuff that customers promise they’ll pay for, or are already paying for – I don’t like re-establishing product-market fit. I like plans that don’t require future technology breakthroughs, because I’ve seen that even geniuses have dry spells. I like plans that don’t require customers, partners, suppliers, regulators, or competitors to do anything dramatically differently – I assume that it is hard to change other people’s minds, because I know it’s hard for them to change mine.
- I like plans that sound dumb to our team because they feel obvious, but sound dumb to outsiders because they require a worldview that only _our_ team deeply understands.
