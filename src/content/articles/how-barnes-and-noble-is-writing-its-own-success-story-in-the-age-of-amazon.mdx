## Summary

Barnes & Noble is successfully revamping its business by focusing on local, community-driven bookstores instead of competing directly with Amazon. The company has seen a boost in sales and plans to open more stores while improving its employee model. Although its e-commerce platform needs work, Barnes & Noble emphasizes a personalized shopping experience that sets it apart from online retailers.

## Highlights

But it doesn’t have the same personal touch as when you go into a Barnes & Noble, where you can receive a personal recommendation, and there are handwritten recommendation cards from members of staff who work in the store.”
