## Summary

New Gartner research emphasizes the importance of empathetic messaging and building “permission structures” that convince people it’s okay to buy.

## Highlights

- “Right now, we’re still in an attitudes and fears and anticipation space that’s driving behavior, and then a reality on the ground is going to shift, and that’s going to change behavior as well,” said Kate Muhl, a Gartner analyst specializing in cultural and consumer insights. “I don’t think a lot of CMOs that I’m seeing are making a lot of changes yet. I think they’ve got to get ready though because of this one-two punch I’m describing.”
- Across the board, brands will need to build “permission structures” that demonstrate value beyond price to convince wary consumers, per Muhl.
- “It’s going to be about expressing, for the right kind of product and category, a kind of empathy with the pressure consumers are feeling, and alternately, finding ways to show how buying your product or buying with your brand is not a high-risk situation,” said Muhl.
