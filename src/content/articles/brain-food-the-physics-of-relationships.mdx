## Summary

While Newtonâ€™s third law was developed with physics in mind, it applies equally well to biology. When pushed on, we push back.

## Highlights
- People who consistently get better results organize their lives in such a way that they are in a position to have better options and are never forced by circumstances into a bad decision.
- The courage to start. 
  The discipline to focus. 
  The confidence to figure it out. 
  The patience to know progress is not always visible. 
  The persistence to keep going, even on the bad days. 
  That's the formula.
