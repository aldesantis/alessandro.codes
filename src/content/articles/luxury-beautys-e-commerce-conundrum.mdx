## Summary

Luxury beauty brands are struggling online as key retailers like Net-a-Porter exit the market, leaving few options for effective sales. Experts believe these brands will focus more on direct-to-consumer sales and partnerships with physical stores. The competition and the need for immersive shopping experiences make online luxury beauty challenging to succeed.

## Highlights

- “You have to over-invest. Beauty is more than just a purchase,” she says. “It’s about the experience you get. It’s about the content that comes with it. It’s about education. You could also argue that beauty online has become so commoditized that it just becomes about price. So, if I’m buying a product at one website, then I’m just going to buy it from somewhere else.”
- “As soon as one player discounts a product, even by one cent, it appears among online search results,” he says. “So, as the number of players offering the same products increases, the acquisition cost of a client becomes more and more expensive. Unlike fashion where luxury retailers can offer exclusivity to their clients, within beauty they have to fight with the exact same offer as their competitors without really much service to offer.”
- You also have Amazon, too, but I don’t think that becomes a discovery destination for luxury beauty brands. I think it’s a replenishment destination, and I think the luxury of it is the convenience. You don’t go on it to launch a brand or build a brand. I think you do it to serve your customer.
