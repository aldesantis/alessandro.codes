## Summary

The article discusses the phenomenon of ironic detachment and apathy that is prevalent in today’s society. It explores how people cope with the lack of meaning and chaos in their lives by adopting a detached and numb attitude. The author argues that this attitude prevents individuals from finding solutions and connecting with others. Possible antidotes to this apathy include embracing honesty, seeking the truth, and embracing reality rather than clinging to an idealized version of life.

## Highlights

- It’s true—so many of the things that once gave the average person’s life real meaning are now treated with sarcasm and contempt: college is a waste of money, work is a waste of your life, getting married is just a piece of paper, having kids is a nightmare, family is a burden, hobbies are merely quaint, earnestly expressing yourself is cringe, leaving the house is exhausting, religion is for idiots, the list goes on. If you allow yourself to internalize this perspective, eventually everything becomes a dumb joke.
- Thanks to the internet and our insatiably consumerist culture, it is finally possible to distract yourself for every waking minute of your life and barely even notice you’re doing it.
- “It is a joy to be hidden, and a disaster not to be found.”
- The whole reason for ironic detachment is to build a protective wall between oneself and the world. We _think_ we’re building a wall, but we’re really hollowing ourselves out from the inside. Eventually, without really noticing it, there will be nothing left for the wall to defend. There will be no one to find.
