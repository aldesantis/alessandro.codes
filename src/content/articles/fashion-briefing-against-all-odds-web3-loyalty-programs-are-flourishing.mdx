## Summary

This week, we take a deep dive into the recent growth of web3 fashion loyalty programs from Lacoste, LVMH and Dior, and the reason brands are separating them from their existing loyalty programs.

## Highlights
- Although there has been a significant NFT market cooldown, some initiatives are thriving, especially with brands like Lacoste and Adidas that have been honing their community over the last couple of years.
- “Web3 loyalty and reward programs are in their infancy, with low user adoption rates, due to friction around end consumer usability and the lack of composability typical of traditional web2 programs,” said Megan Kaspar, managing director of web3 investment at investment firm Magnetic. “The software integration is also not yet seamless or composable.”
