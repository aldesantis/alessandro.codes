## Summary

Brands are increasingly partnering with popular live streamers to reach younger audiences, who prefer authentic and relatable content over traditional advertising. However, the unregulated nature of streaming can lead to risky behavior and controversies that may affect brand reputation. To succeed, brands must carefully vet streamers and ensure their values align, while being prepared to respond to any potential crises.

## Highlights

- Data from Gen Z and millennial market research agency YPulse shows that nearly a third (32 per cent) of 13 to 39-year-olds watch live-stream content weekly, with online influencers topping the list of public figures they trust.
- But with the explosive rise of lifestyle, comedy and prank streaming, comes a murky world of unchecked behaviour, controversy and risk — for both creators and the brands that partner with them. Much of the content is unregulated and real-time, meaning the boundaries of what is acceptable are constantly being pushed.
- The live nature of streaming creates a level of intimacy and authenticity that traditional influencers often struggle to replicate, says MaryLeigh Bliss, chief content officer at YPulse.
- YPulse research reveals that 83 per cent of Gen Zs and millennials are more likely to trust someone who feels relatable and “like them”. Streamers, often broadcasting from their bedrooms or gaming setups, embody that relatability, continues Bliss.
- For brands, there is a QVC dynamic that is highly appealing — you can track exact viewership at any given moment in time with the added benefit that the stream is always posted afterwards, gaining even more viewership.
- Streaming platforms allow for more creative integrations — such as broadcast overlays, widgets that can creatively embed logos and track live sales, or interactive integrations added throughout a gamer’s gameplay — so converting a viewer into a consumer is a seamless experience
- “In the same way that algorithms rely on extreme content to win our attention, streamers appeal to their audience’s most intense emotions to sustain views,” she says. “This can manifest in both extreme, right-wing content that speaks to the disillusionment of much of their young male audience, as well as problematic spectacle-making stunts to drive views.”
- “It’s important that you understand the individual and what they stand for. If you don’t spend time with those individuals and understand who they are and what makes them tick, you leave yourself vulnerable to connecting with individuals who won’t be great ambassadors for you throughout the lifetime of your partnership.”
