## Summary

The newsletter that takes the guesswork out of building and scaling a D2C brand.

## Highlights
- the way to analyze or determine whether your business is healthy or not, is by looking at the ratio between your CAC and your LTV. If your CAC is $50 and your LTV is $150, then your LTV:CAC is 3.
- So you basically need to analyze; "What is my LTV:CAC by different cohorts, such as 3 months after purchase, 6 months after purchase, 9, 12, etc."

- if you have many SKUs (which we recommend you to have to increase your LTV in general), then you need to understand what your LTV per SKU is too.
- The way we think about it is: LTV consists of 4 components - which are:
  • Why should someone buy from you again, and why should they do it now?
  • Do YOU give THEM the ability to buy from you again (We'll elaborate in a sec here)
  • How is the experience of buying from your brand?
  • What value do you add to your customers other than the product?
