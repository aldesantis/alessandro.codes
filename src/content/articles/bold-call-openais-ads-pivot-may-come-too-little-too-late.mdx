## Summary

OpenAI plans to add ads to ChatGPT this year, but it may be late to compete with Google. Google already runs ads in its AI tools and has strong advertiser relationships. OpenAI must improve ad targeting and measurement to attract brands and succeed.

## Highlights

- People come to ChatGPT to get something done — not to browse, discover or be interrupted. And ChatGPT is built for open-ended answers, not repeatable inventory. Brands want control and context, while AI chat interfaces deliver neither with any consistency. And they want a means to measure the impact of their messaging they can compare with other channels.
