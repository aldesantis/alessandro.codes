## Summary

The article discusses how luxury brands, like those highlighted in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s,” rely on perceived value rather than necessity. It contrasts low-cost retailers like Walmart, which thrive by offering high-value essentials, with high-cost luxury goods that can be vulnerable during economic downturns. The author warns that today’s saturated market makes it challenging for brands to stand out, emphasizing the need for precision in brand messaging.

## Highlights

- Veblen writes, “In order to gain and to hold the esteem of men it is not sufficient merely to possess wealth or power. The wealth or power must be put in evidence, for esteem is awarded only on evidence” (_The Theory of the Leisure Class_, 1899).
- It’s important not to confuse these two terms: value is subjective, determined by a product’s importance to the consumer based on its necessity, shelf life, and quality, while cost is merely relative to average income and competing options.
- While diamonds are scarce, consumers believe that the perceived scarcity of a non-essential item makes it essential, thereby inflating its personal value.
- At [Igloo](http://igloomedia.co), we’ve found that boutique fashion brands, while very much dependant by factors like product quality and design, offer remarkable insights into consumer loyalty. With some customers exceeding 10 purchase cycles, these brands operate similarly to subscription services, showcasing impressive lifetime value.
- While lifetime value may remain strong, often tied to new product drops or seasonality, the lower price points lead to thinner margins and a higher percentage loss on product returns relative to net income. This makes scaling profitably much harder, limiting flexibility when testing trends or experimenting with advertising. Consequently, lower-value fashion is often better suited for B2B and retail models, rather than competing heavily on paid channels like Google or Facebook.
- While brand-building tools are more accessible than ever, I hope this doesn’t deter founders from innovating and creating brands that paddle against the current.
