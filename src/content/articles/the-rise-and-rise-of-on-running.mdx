## Summary

On Running has become a popular brand worn by athletes, celebrities, and trendsetters worldwide. The company's success is attributed to its innovative product designs and strategic collaborations. On Running is expanding its market presence and focusing on authentic engagement with new communities and markets.

## Highlights
- “The omnichannel journey for us has truly come to fruition over the past couple of years. Direct-to-consumer's very fast growth also has a fast decline. We wanted another journey. Wholesale, own ecom, own retail. It was the journey that we felt was the best for longevity. When we open a store in London, we also see uptick on our dot com and our wholesalers there. In the past, there was a misconception that opening your own stores meant cannibalising relationships with wholesale partners, that’s not true. If you can crack the code of it all together and work as an ecosystem that’s where the power is.”

- “In the space of collaborations. We always knew we didn’t want to be in the fast collaboration space where one is almost indistinguishable from the next drop. So we always wanted to look for longer-term partners,” On’s Alex Griffin told us.
