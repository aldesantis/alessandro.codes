## Summary

But that’s not the only reason so many fashion brands struggle to grow the DTC channel.

## Highlights

- If you want consumers to choose your brand over your wholesale accounts, you need to provide a distinct value prop, cater the experience to impulse shoppers, or build a brand so strong that shopping DTC becomes a status symbol. Your wholesale accounts will probably have you beat in terms of cost, convenience and overall selection.
- Most eCom businesses only retain 20-30 of every 100 new customers they acquire. If your brand isn’t selling a subscription product (most fashion brands aren’t), new customer acquisition is critical to growth.

- Time is the secret ingredient in the luxury strategy. A brand needs time to establish the credibility required to speak from a position of cultural authority. Achieving the title of “status symbol” can happen faster, but the shelf life is shorter.
- Be thoughtful about the competitors you look at for guidance. If they’ve been in the market longer, have more sales turnover, or have greater consumer awareness, their strategies may not work for you.
