## Summary

Off-White, once a symbol of innovative streetwear under founder Virgil Abloh, has been sold to Bluestar Alliance, raising concerns about its future. The brand management group has a history of devaluing labels it acquires, often prioritizing quick profits over long-term brand integrity. As luxury sales decline, there is skepticism about whether Bluestar can successfully navigate Off-White’s legacy and the broader challenges facing the fashion industry.

## Highlights

- The US has never managed to build a luxury conglomerate to rival that of LVMH, Richemont or Kering in Europe. These companies are long-term investors in their brands, quite the opposite of private equity and brand management companies that seek to squeeze out revenue with licences and collaborations.
- When a brand is worth more as intellectual property than as a maker of goods, it’s tempting to slap that name all over the place, raising memories of ’80s-era Gucci, when the company began licensing its name to board games, sports gear and other products that had little to do with the Italian brand.
