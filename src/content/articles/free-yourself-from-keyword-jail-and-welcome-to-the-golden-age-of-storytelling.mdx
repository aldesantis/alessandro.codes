## Summary

Brands used to focus on just a few keywords to sell products online, but this limited their storytelling. Now, with advanced AI like large language models (LLMs), brands can share rich stories and details about products to better connect with shoppers. This new approach helps digital assistants act like expert salespeople, making shopping more personal and effective.

## Highlights

- Data from four independent sources (academia, UX researchers, YouGov, Accenture) surveying large sets of consumers consistently tells us:
  - Consumers trust GenAI/LLMs more than websites, friends, social media
  - The _**only thing**_ that scores as high is a physical store.
