## Summary

The text discusses the concept of the Iterative Adjacent Possible, highlighting the importance of embracing limitations to unlock potential and achieve long-term success with lower risk. It emphasizes the need to make decisions within the realm of the adjacent possible, where choices are more likely to succeed. By breaking down decisions into smaller, manageable steps and making iterative judgments, individuals and companies can navigate uncertainties and discover new possibilities. The text also contrasts this approach with the traditional “heroic leap” technique, pointing out the benefits of the Iterative Adjacent Possible in generating value and minimizing risk. Overall, it encourages embracing uncertainty and making small, strategic decisions to realize significant outcomes.

## Highlights

- But here’s the bummer, the uncomfortable truth, the curse that dooms us to cycles of despair: **our adjacent possibles are _significantly_ smaller than we’d like to believe**. The system of constraints operating on us at any point leave very little maneuvering room and box us in significantly. The clouds of uncertainty in the future get thicker at a compounding rate as they extend in front of us, so it’s hard to see beyond our noses, and _impossible_ to see beyond arm’s reach.
- If you’re in a position where you get 10,000 lottery tickets each with a 99.99% chance of failure, you should do it. If you only get a _single_ lottery ticket then it’s probably not the right choice. Investors can purchase multiple tickets at once, but as an individual you only have one career, and typically can only have a single job at a time.
- When you make _one_ big bold long-range decision, you’re effectively locking in many smaller decisions before you have enough information to make a good judgment call on how to make them! Instead, slice up those decisions to start and only make the ones you need to make now, deferring the rest.
- Using your brain takes space and time; if you are sprinting, using your brawn to its limits, you won’t have the ability to use your brain. To use your brain you must take a step back from the action to gain a slightly wider vantage point. When you do so it will look like you are “taking it easy” or taking yourself away from what matters. It will seem almost self-indulgent. If you aren’t confident in your abilities and the value you’re offering you might be cowed into not doing it. But that’s a trap, dooming you to a downward spiral. Your brawn has a limit: you’ll never be able to run faster than a 3:40 mile, no matter how hard you train. Your brain is what steers you and gives your actions leverage. A better judgment on what to do, paired with execution, can lead you to significantly better results.
- The most important thing is that the action you take will clear the bar for survival. If you die in the next round, then there will be no future rounds to play. This is a bar to clear, not to maximize.
- If there is a lot of uncertainty — you don’t know which of many plausible long-term directions will turn out to be the right one — then pick the action that is at least neutral in all plausible future directions you want to go, and ideally adds at least some value in many possible futures. That is, a step that you almost certainly will not regret in the future.

- A typical business analysis might sight off of the long-term Total Addressable Market (TAM) of an idea. But what matters most is not the absolute size of the TAM in the far-future, but _the slope of the path to achieve that TAM_. If the first five years of investment are expected to have zero returns before back-loaded returns, it’s almost certain you’ll give up before you ever see any value.
- One tactic for navigating your iterative adjacent possible is to use a scavenger mindset. Instead of creating everything you need from whole cloth, look around to find pre-existing objects that you can duct-tape together into novel combinations.
- For most people in most of society, we _under_count how many potentially value-creating moves we have within our grasp. In Silicon Valley — especially in contexts adgance to buckets of VC-funded capital — we tend to over-estimate. That’s because in order to make the case for lots of capital, we have to tell an absurdly optimistic story, and then it’s easiest to navigate that story if you come to earnestly believe it yourself, too.
