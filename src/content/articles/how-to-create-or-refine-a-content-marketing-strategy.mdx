## Summary

A good content marketing strategy is the key to getting a return on your content investment. Learn the essential elements of the perfect content strategy.

## Highlights

- It’s important to use real people and not fictitious personas because it affects your approach to creating content. Creating content for “SaaS Sally” is very different than writing for your friend Ty Magnin who runs marketing at Appcues.
- • Blogs that act like publications create series of standalone posts on different topics. They are hesitant to cover the same topic more than once.
  - Blogs that act like libraries create hubs of related posts. They have the freedom [to cover the same core topics over and over again](https://www.animalz.co/blog/content-marketing-power-laws/).
- Here’s the golden rule of content marketing strategy: compounding growth is the only growth. Don’t invest significant time in non-recurring acquisition channels. When it comes down to it, organic search and your own email list are the only channels you can count on.
- **Content Length and Depth:** Most research says that longer posts rank better. That fits nicely with the idea of publishing less often but does require plenty of writing. Brian Dean recommends a minimum of 1,900 words per post.
