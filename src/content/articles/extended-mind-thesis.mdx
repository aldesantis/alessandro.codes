## Summary

The extended mind thesis (EMT) states that the mind goes beyond the brain and body, incorporating elements from the environment. Proposed by Andy Clark and David Chalmers, it argues that objects like notebooks can function as extensions of our cognitive processes. Critics of EMT question its implications and the distinction between internal and external cognition.

## Highlights

- In [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind), the **extended mind thesis** (**EMT**) says that the [mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind) does not exclusively reside in the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) or even the [body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_body), but extends into the [physical world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surroundings).[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_mind_thesis#cite_note-WilsonR-1) The EMT proposes that some objects in the external environment can be part of a [cognitive process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_process) and in that way function as extensions of the mind itself.
