In 30 Minutes

## Summary

High agency is the ability to solve problems effectively and take action, even in difficult situations. It combines clear thinking, a bias to act, and a willingness to disagree with the norm. People with high agency creatively navigate challenges and embrace their uniqueness, often leading to extraordinary outcomes.

## Highlights

- Optimism states the glass is half full. Pessimism states the glass is half empty.
  **High agency states you’re a tap. You look in the mirror and see a giant tap staring back at you.**
- High agency can be a confusing idea to understand because it’s not just one idea. It’s a combination of three distinct skills rarely found together:
  1. Clear thinking
  2. Bias to action
  3. Disagreeability
- If you meet your heroes or read their biographies, you discover Superman is often Clark Kent. The movie studio of your mind placed this imperfect human on a flawless pedastal.
- Don’t put any adult on a pedestal. Kill your gurus. A more useful belief: The ‘adults’ aren’t going to save you — they don’t even exist.
- If you’re stuck in a low agency trap, you’re both the guard and the prisoner of the jail cell. The self-imposed prison exists purely in how your imagination frames reality.
