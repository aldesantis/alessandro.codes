## Summary

The internet is becoming crowded with bots and generic content, making it hard for people to find authentic connections. As large language models generate human-like text, we need to prove our humanity by being original and critical thinkers. To combat this darkening online landscape, fostering real-life relationships and unique expressions will become increasingly important.

## Highlights

- The [dark forest theory](https://maggieappleton.com/cozy-web) of the web points to the increasingly life-like but life-less state of being online.[1](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest/#footnote-1) Most open and publicly available spaces on the web are overrun with bots, advertisers, trolls, data scrapers, clickbait, keyword-stuffing “content creators,” and algorithmically manipulated junk.
  It’s like a dark forest that seems eerily devoid of human life – all the living creatures are hidden beneath the ground or up in trees. If they reveal themselves, they risk being attacked by automated predators.
- Referencing obscure concepts, friends who are real but not famous, niche interests, and recent events all make you plausibly more human.[6](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest/#footnote-6) 2. Be original, critical, and sophisticated
- [](https://maggieappleton.com/ai-dark-forest/#footnote-7)Language models regurgitate text from across the web, which some humans read and recycle into “original creations,” which then become fodder to train other language models, and around and around we go recycling generic ideas and arguments and tropes and ways of thinking.
- The linguist [Ferdinand de Saussure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure) argued there are two kinds of language:
  - **La langue** is the formal concept of language. These are words we print in the dictionary, distribute via educational institutions, and reprimand one another for getting it wrong.
  - **La parole** is the speech of everyday life. These are the informal, diverse, and creative speech acts we perform in conversations, social gatherings, and text to the group WhatsApp. This is where language evolves.
