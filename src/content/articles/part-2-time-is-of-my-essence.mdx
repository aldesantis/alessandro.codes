## Summary

People have been altering time to suit their needs, impacting how we perceive the world today. Technology plays a significant role in our struggle with time, affecting our cultural connections. The individual control over time and consumption leads to unique experiences and challenges in connecting with others.

## Highlights

- As cited by Bentley and O’Brien, “historian Abby Smith Rumsey argued that vast amounts of digital information hinder our collective capacity for forgetting, which is an important behavioral trait that clears away informational clutter, making room for creative thought.”
- To put it in the terms of Bentley and O’Brien, traditions can’t emerge if there’s no common time or place to reach back to. We attempt to re-anchor ourselves to time and place in various ways, like rewatch podcasts of popular shows and online forums that provide the contextual notes that have otherwise been lost over time. But the additional consumption required (“now I have to watch a show AND listen to a podcast about the show AND read a Subreddit about the show?”) creates a barrier to context that can feel insurmountable
- We’ve all seen the viral photos of a sold-out concert lit by the phones of thousands recording the moment. Regardless of the quality of their recording, each person is doing so in the hopes that one day they can revisit that specific time. They don’t know when they’ll watch the clip again, but the time they choose will carry a personal meaning that no one else can truly connect to. A shared mono or subcultural experience, made Solo by the recollection of it.
