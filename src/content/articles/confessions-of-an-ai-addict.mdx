## Summary

The author, Tim Metz, shares his struggle with AI addiction, realizing it numbs creativity and promotes laziness in thinking. He emphasizes the importance of doing original work before relying on AI, as it can distort reality and lead to dependency. To combat this, Metz encourages regular breaks from AI and urges others to prioritize deep thinking and research.

## Highlights

- The main thesis is that you, the human, should always fill “the blank page,” before involving AI. Otherwise, if you let the algorithms go first, they’ll anchor your thinking to their ideas, or worse, lull your brain to sleep.
- There’s no blanker page than the one you have to fill by hand. It feels tedious, but it’s a highway to the depths of your mind.
- AI dumping turns your laziness into someone else’s problem. Because you’re neither thinking nor curating an AI’s output, you overload someone else with slop to wade through.
- If all you do is dump the output of a prompt on someone, better send them the prompt (so they can understand and refine the input) or do nothing at all.
- My pre-AI self would never believe I would have to write this rule, but it’s true: you can’t skip reading the research. Not just to catch hallucinations, but to understand the topic, [have a point of view](https://www.animalz.co/blog/find-the-right-angle/), and be able to judge the AI’s work.
