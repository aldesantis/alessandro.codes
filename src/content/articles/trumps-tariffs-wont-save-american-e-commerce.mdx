## Summary

Trump’s tariffs on Chinese imports won’t help American e-commerce businesses and may even hurt them. Instead of shifting market share to U.S. sellers, these tariffs have increased prices for American consumers and pushed many domestic businesses toward bankruptcy. Chinese sellers continue to dominate U.S. marketplaces due to their advantages in manufacturing and supply chains.

## Highlights

- In 2018, the first Trump administration imposed tariffs on $283 billion of imports. A [*Journal of Economic Perspectives* study](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.4.187) found these tariffs were “almost completely passed through into U.S. domestic prices,” meaning American consumers and importers, not Chinese exporters, paid the cost. By December 2018, those tariffs cost Americans $3.2 billion per month in additional tax costs and an additional $1.4 billion per month in deadweight welfare losses—economic activity that disappeared due to market distortions.
- While tariff advocates cite short-term pain for long-term gain, diverting even a small percentage of Chinese manufacturing back to the U.S. would take years. However, the impact on American e-commerce businesses is both immediate and potentially devastating.
- Unprecedented tariff rates are forcing domestic e-commerce businesses into impossible choices: scrambling for emergency capital at predatory interest rates, abandoning shipments they can’t afford to clear, or attempting to raise prices in an already price-sensitive market. Without imminent policy changes, many face the threat of bankruptcy. Ironically, these are the very businesses these tariffs were ostensibly designed to protect.
