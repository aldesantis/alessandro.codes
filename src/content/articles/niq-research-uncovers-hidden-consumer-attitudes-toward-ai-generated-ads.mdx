## Summary

NielsenIQ's new research shows that consumers find AI-generated ads less engaging and more annoying than traditional ads. The study highlights that these ads may weaken brand perception and memory activation. Advertisers should focus on quality and authenticity to avoid negative impacts on brand equity.

## Highlights
- Brands and agencies are innovating at a rapid pace, leveraging AI-generated content in their advertising. They need to be cautious, as our study reveals that consumers are quite sensitive to the authenticity of ad creatives, both at the implicit (nonconscious) and explicit (conscious) levels. Brands must prioritize insights-led creative evaluation to produce effective ads.
- Consumers intuitively identified most of the AI-generated ads, perceiving them as less engaging and more “annoying,” “boring,” and “confusing” than traditional ads. These sentiments suggest that AI-generated ads may create a negative halo effect that could dampen consumer perceptions of both the ad *and* the brand.
- AI-generated ads—even those perceived as “high quality”—elicited weaker memory activation in the brain, compared to traditional ads. This reaction suggests a misalignment between the content and existing memory structures—a gap that could impede consumers’ motivation to act.
- By drawing from pre-existing visual and conceptual representations, AI-generated ads successfully reinforced existing brand associations. Coupled with the negative halo effect, however, this benefit could be outweighed by overall negative perceptions.
- Low-quality visuals in AI-generated ads increase the cognitive effort required to process them, distracting from the intended message. High-quality execution is essential for effective storytelling and brand communication.
