## Summary

Clarks has maintained relevance over 200 years by embracing new trends, commerce channels, and countercultures, staying steady in the footwear industry. Chief Marketing and Digital Officer Tara McRae discusses the challenge of understanding customer Muses deeply and bringing the brand closer to them. Clarks aims to innovate in various ways to connect with consumers, including creating a virtual world in Roblox called CICAVERSE. Tara emphasizes the importance of delivering the best brand experience across all channels and staying culturally relevant, especially with younger consumers who engage through platforms like Roblox and YouTube.

## Highlights

- The philosophy we take is to ensure that wherever that consumer wants to buy, they have the best brand experience. We’re not there yet at all, but we have consumers, younger consumers, who want to buy through social media; we want to make sure that journey is seamless. We have consumers who only want to buy through eCommerce, and we have consumers who want the sit-and-fit experience in stores. I’m not going to force any of these people to try to be omnichannel if that’s not what they want.
- I’m a huge fan of data, insights, and market intelligence, but some of it is knowing culture, networking, and being a consumer yourself.
