## Summary

The CQ is Forerunner’s weekly newsletter rounding up the most pressing consumer news and analysis, plus some bonus musings from our investment team.

## Highlights

- Spending likely to remain elevated: 71% of respondents plan to spend the same or more this year compared to last year. This lines up with the 38% increase in real consumer spend since 2007 and the median consumer having 50% more disposable income since 200.
- Consumers spend to enjoy life: 50% of respondents report ‘spending to live in the moment’ (as opposed to ‘saving to retire as early as possible’). Half of the ‘live in the moment’ spenders switched to this approach over the past few years.
