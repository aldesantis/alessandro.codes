## Summary

Resale platforms at fast-fashion retailers may do little to reduce emissions and companies like H&M and Shein are better off investing in their supply chains.

## Highlights

- It found that fast-fashion retailers, which create about 11.5 kilograms (25.3 pounds) of carbon dioxide for every item they make, will only reduce their emissions by 0.7% with resale programs.
