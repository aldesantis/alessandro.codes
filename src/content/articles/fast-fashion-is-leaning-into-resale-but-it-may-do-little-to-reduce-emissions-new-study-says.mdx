## Summary

Resale platforms at fast-fashion retailers may do little to reduce emissions and companies like H&M and Shein are better off investing in their supply chains.

## Highlights

- It found that fast-fashion retailers, which create about 11.5 kilograms (25.3 pounds) of carbon dioxide for every item they make, will only reduce their emissions by 0.7% with resale programs.

- To reduce their impact on the environment, fast-fashion retailers are better off redirecting their resale investments into recycling innovations and sustainable materials, among other practices that can reduce emissions, said Gayle Tait, Troveâ€™s CEO.
