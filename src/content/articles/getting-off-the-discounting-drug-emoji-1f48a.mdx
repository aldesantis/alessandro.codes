## Summary

Before we jump in, It’s week 2/4 in TLV, and I owe you a weekly coffee update: Dama: 9. 1.

## Highlights

- One of the best ways to move away from discounting is to enhance what makes your brand unique and valuable beyond price.
- Bundling products or offering gifts with purchases (GWP) can provide value without reducing prices. By bundling complementary products, you can increase the perceived value of a purchase.
