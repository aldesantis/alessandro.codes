## Summary

I hope you had a wonderful day off––if you had it off––and maybe even took a 4-day weekend. I sure did!

## Highlights

- For content strategy for 2026, I hope you, too, are thinking about art. Thought leadership should be art. Some of your campaigns should be art. Broadly applicable to your target audience, and something that makes them think and feel––not necessarily act.
