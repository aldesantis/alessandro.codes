## Summary

Many people do not plan for the end of their careers, which can lead to unsatisfying jobs. It’s important to actively think about your career goals and take steps to achieve them. Start planning now to ensure you reach your desired career destination.

## Highlights

- If you love what you’re doing now and don’t ever want to change jobs, great: you’ve reached the end of your career, even if it plays out over many decades. If you don’t love it, though, and that’s much more likely, then it’s worth asking what job you _would_ love, and how you’re going to get it.
- Lao Tzu teaches: the best fighter is never angry. More important than the blow is knowing **when** to strike. Like, perhaps, after we experience the executive whitewater rafting trip in Coeur d’Alene.
- You can’t stop the waves, as the saying goes, but you can [learn to surf](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/posts/tao-of-go).
