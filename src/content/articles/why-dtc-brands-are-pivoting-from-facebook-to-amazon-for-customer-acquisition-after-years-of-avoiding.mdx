## Summary

DTC brands are selling on Amazon as they face rising customer-acquisition costs, but launching on the platform doesn’t guarantee success.

## Highlights

- If you’re a brand owner and you want to use the tool to increase reach and efficiency, you need to understand that they’re not a direct partner where you share a common goal. Amazon doesn’t care if you succeed.
- Before launching on Amazon, DTC startups should have strong brand awareness, plenty of inventory, and a dedicated team working solely on all facets of the Amazon business, from the algorithmic structure to order fulfillment

- While there are fees associated with selling on Amazon, Naim and McKee said the platform wasn’t as likely to eat into a brand’s profit margins in the way a traditional retailer — which buys product up front and charges for unsold, returned, or damaged inventory — would.
- Spending money on advertising outside of Amazon can also help boost a brand’s presence on Amazon’s search results, Naim said, since customers may be more likely to search for that brand by name.
