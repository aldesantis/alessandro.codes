## Summary

The author reflects on the nature of attraction and relationships, inspired by Gertrude Steinâ€™s perspective on not labeling desire. He shares his experience of meeting his wife, Johanna, and the unique connection they have through deep conversations. The piece emphasizes the importance of recognizing and valuing meaningful relationships, even when they are hard to explain to others.

## Highlights

- Some relationships can easily be compressed into a compelling string of words. This is usually because they conform to some sort of trope of how romance should look. In my experience, great relationships are harder to compress into a sensible string of words.
