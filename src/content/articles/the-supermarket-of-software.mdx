- For any product to reach its adoption and commercial potential, its value must be exceptional enough to displace an existing product, behavior or belief. It must do so for customers who can also help grow your business. Figuring this out is an iterative, dynamic process in which every product leader must be a partner and ask “what can we do better to enable evangelistic product adoption?”
