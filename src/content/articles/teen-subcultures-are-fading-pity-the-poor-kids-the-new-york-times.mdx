## Summary

Teen subcultures are evolving, with modern teenagers engaging in a wide array of online aesthetics that lack the depth and community connection of past subcultures. These new aesthetics come and go rapidly, often existing only in the digital realm without real-world ties or shared experiences. While today’s teenagers are exploring different aesthetics to find identity and validation, the fleeting nature of these cultural trends can lead to a sense of disconnectedness and lack of meaningful connections compared to the vibrant subcultures of the past. The shift from tangible, immersive subcultures to online aesthetics highlights a cultural shift that may leave young people yearning for the communal experiences and deep connections that defined previous eras.

## Highlights

- If you are a teenager or have exposure to teenagers, what I am about to write is something you probably know already. Subcultures _in general_ — once the poles of style and art and politics and music around which wound so many ribbons of teenage meaning — have largely collapsed.
- Yet when I look at the younger people in my life — the teenagers crate-digging through these details, arguing about “dark academia” versus “light academia” or the differences between “goblincore” and “crowcore” — it doesn’t seem to me that they want to negate meaning. It seems as though they are looking, hard, for identity, for validation, for the dignification of their taste. It’s just that they are being presented with these thin cultural planes that barely exist outside their devices.
