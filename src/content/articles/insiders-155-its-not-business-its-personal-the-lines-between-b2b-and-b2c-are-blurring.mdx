## Summary

All people and households have become businesses. How did we get here?

## Highlights

- What’s the difference between the Shopify that Mattel is building on vs. what your neighbor built their handmade pottery site on? The difference between downmarket software and enterprise software is often less than expected.
- For example, one thing B2B companies often do well is help their clients understand how to best leverage the product. They give them best practices for how to employ the product, and also marketing and sales. In B2C, the integration of “product use case” and the pipeline to employ the product in an optimal way is still often a disjointed process.
