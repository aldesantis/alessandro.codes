#13: Revelation and Discovery

## Summary

The text discusses different types of uncertainty: involuntary and voluntary, internal and external. It highlights the importance of facing uncertainty to discover new ways of making sense of oneself and the environment. Embracing voluntary uncertainty can lead to personal growth and fulfillment.

## Highlights

- One clear division is that **uncertainty can be involuntary or voluntary**: it can either be revealed to you against your will or you can actively search for and discover it. Another clear division is that **uncertainty can be internal or external**: it can either be about your individual sense of self or about how well that sense of self fits with your environment.
- Uncertainty will always be uncomfortable and expensive. Choosing to engage in _voluntary_ uncertainty offers the chance to confront it on your own terms—at a level you can manage, at a moment that is more likely to be optimal, and when you have the resources to absorb the cost—and (possibly) to enter a state of productive internal and external exploration.
