## Summary

Grace Gordon shares a case study on building brand energy by connecting with influential city communities and creating cultural hits like “BRAT” by Charli XCX. The key is to authentically engage with fans both online and offline, providing tools for creative expression and building a lifestyle platform around the brand. Brands can learn from this approach by designing products that resonate with their core audience, facilitating community engagement, and simplifying brand codes to inspire participation and expression.

## Highlights

- Cultural companies design products from the core of the community they want to serve, _and_ are open to expanding their brand story into something more akin to a lifestyle vs. a one-off product. Bringing your co-creators upstream with you, and knowing exactly what you’re designing for is a way to guarantee adoption and amplification. Identifying a muse target audience and inviting them into the creation process with you has no downside.

- Brands do not need to take on a role of ‘building’ community if they can act in the more credible role of ‘facilitating’ it (hat tip [Marcus Collins](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8DDlm4PjId/)). Giving a defined and engaged audience the simplest set of tools or an experience, and letting them do what they do, is better than briefing a creator within an inch of their life on the most prescriptive, product-marketing heavy ask you’ve ever seen.
- The simpler and more easy your brand codes are to emulate, the more participation and expression you can inspire. Embrace a lo-fi, hands-on system.
