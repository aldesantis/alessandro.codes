## Summary

The article discusses the future of ecommerce, highlighting the need for a more considered and sustainable approach. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding consumer behavior and crafting better experiential tech to improve user experiences. They also discuss the potential impact of IoT on ecommerce, predicting that it will become a passive part of our lives, similar to how electricity became a utility. The article addresses the challenges facing the retail industry, including outdated business models, poor governance, and the need for better marketing strategies. The author concludes by urging businesses to adapt to the changing landscape of ecommerce and plan for the future.

## Highlights

- The challenge for retail and more so for ecommerce, is that we are as blind as we ever were to consumer behaviour. We still know relatively little. Partly, because, we as consumers do not either. Discovery is a passive experience of knowledge transfer and rarely borne out of need.
- It has never been more abundantly evident to me that we need to view the function of ecommerce as a utility, in the same way electricity was adopted used to power the second industrial revolution.
- In the report, Ian and the team challenge retail to craft better experiential tech. With investment drying up, this is where real ingenuity will be formed. No more half baked attempts at personalisation or loyalty. No, not this time. Real, meaningful and new tech is what we need.
- Companies that do not belong to a community of discourse will die.
- **Marketing and advertising have been bastardised** and amalgamated into this industry we call digital marketing. I have thought alot about this over the last number of months. Why do we get this so wrong. Always.
