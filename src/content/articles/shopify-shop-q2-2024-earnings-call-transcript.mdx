## Summary

Shopify is experiencing strong growth, with a 34% increase in B2B orders and a 30% rise in international merchants. Their marketing efforts are effectively attracting both new and existing brands, resulting in a 51% increase in enterprise merchant acquisition. Overall, Shopify is well-positioned to continue expanding and improving commerce globally.

## Highlights

- In Q2, we saw 25% revenue growth when excluding logistics, with gross profit growing faster than revenue. Operating expenses decreased quarter over quarter and our free cash flow margin more than doubled to 16% from last year.
- As you may have seen in our recent edition, unification was the central theme. So what do we mean by that? Well, we believe that the mark of great software is that as it scales and grows, each new feature is built as if it were there from the very beginning. Everything works together harmoniously, crafted in consistent style and quality.

- In Q2, offline GMV was up 27% year over year as we continued to attract larger global merchants with multiple store locations.
- In Q2, we recorded our highest ever B2B GMV month with a 140% year-over-year increase fueled by the growth of our Plus merchants. Our B2B offering also saw a six x increase in online orders compared to last year, underscoring the value of self-serve B2B purchasing.
- Plus, we’ve seen a 34% increase in the number of merchants getting B2B orders on Shopify compared to last year.
- Cross-border sales made up about 14% of our GMV in Q2, and merchants are really eager to reach new regions, especially when they notice more and more international traffic on their sites.

- In Q2, Shopify Payments penetration was 61% and Shop Pay facilitated $16 billion in GMV, up 45% from last year.
- Our international GMV growth continues to outpace North America, up 27% from last year, driven by two main goals, expanding our presence and introducing more products in more markets.
- And in Q2, our marketing and go-to-market efforts led to a 30% increase in international merchant growth year over year.
- This quarter represents the fifth straight quarter where we have delivered GMV growth in Europe exceeding 30%.
- Q2 revenue was $2 billion, up 21% year over year, which equates to 25% year-over-year growth when excluding the logistics businesses. This marks the fifth straight quarter where our revenue growth, excluding logistics, has grown 25% or greater.
- We didn’t see any significant deterioration or improvement throughout the quarter. On the last call, we talked a little bit about, from a European perspective, what we may see in terms of FX headwinds, and we talked a little bit about what we saw in terms of consumer spend.
- So the wonderful part of our business model is it’s not relying on one particular type of merchant and one particular geography.
  We have merchants coming to us for B2B and merchants that doing direct-to-consumer.
- And I think a big part of the reason that we are not seeing the same thing that others might is because we simply have merchants across a ton of verticals and across a ton of geos.
