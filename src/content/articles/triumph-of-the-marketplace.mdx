## Summary

Retail after the website

## Highlights

- Nearly two thirds of Gen Z shops mostly in physical stores, according to Retail Touch Points, an online publishing network. Younger consumers [perceive shopping](https://retail-assist.com/gen-z-vs-gen-x-vs-gen-y-shopping-habits-survey/) as a social activity, entertainment, fun, and a pastime that - through selfies, photos, polls and product reviews - bridges digital and physical worlds. Shopping gives them the opportunity to showcase their taste, create social capital, and influence others.
- Entertainment, community and curation - not heavily branded experiences or long checkout paths - are the blueprint of modern commerce. Modern commerce is more like the digital version of going to a mall than scrolling through products on an e-commerce site. Modern commerce is rich in serendipity, product discovery, socializing, and entertainment. It looks more like a leisure activity than a transactional exchange thatâ€™s been over-optimized.
- Instead of dragging customers through ever more elaborate funnels, retailers need to create short, mini funnels across their entire decentralized retail network.
- the goal should be a personalized, social, curated image feed that is serendipitous enough to be fun and entertaining enough to want to continue to scroll through. Instead of a massive menu of products, which puts the burden of search on the customer, retailers need a conveyor belt-like experience, with scroll options that are designed around anticipation, surprise, fun and impulse buys.
- Websites continue to play a role in retail. They can feature new daily product drops, host special edition products, offer online-only collections and capsules, promote the icons and the bestseller, or they can host highly personalized membership portals. But they are neither brand hubs nor warehouses, collapsing under the weight of heavily over-branded product imagery and auto-play campaign videos.
