## Summary

I’ve designed Ariyh Pro specifically for marketers and founders who use the latest science to drive better marketing results.

## Highlights

- Give customers incentives to leave a review for your product. For example, give them a discount on future purchases, or enter them in a sweepstake. You don’t need to ask specifically for positive reviews (which can be unethical), simply incentivize the act of giving a review.
  Try to identify your most satisfied and loyal customers (e.g. repeat buyers) to give these incentives to.
  You will get more reviews, and they will be more likely to be positive.
