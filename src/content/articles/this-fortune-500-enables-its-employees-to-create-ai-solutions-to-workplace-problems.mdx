## Summary

Colgate-Palmolive created an internal AI Hub where employees can safely build and use AI assistants to solve work problems. This approach lets workers across the company make helpful tools without needing IT or coding skills. Thousands of AI assistants have been made, improving work locally and globally.

## Highlights

When we looked at what was available for free publicly to people, we had to at least replicate what they could do outside.
