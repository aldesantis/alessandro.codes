The Type 2 Manifesto

## Summary

Zoe Scaman's "The Type 2 Manifesto" challenges the traditional view of success, advocating for a focus on lasting impact rather than constant productivity. It emphasizes the importance of creating meaningful work and finding joy in the everyday, rather than chasing quick wins. The manifesto calls for a new blueprint that values depth, resilience, and personal growth at one's own pace.

## Highlights

In a culture obsessed with constant productivity, we've forgotten this fundamental truth: creativity and growth require rest. These fallow periods aren't signs of laziness or lack of ambition—they're essential spaces where innovation takes root.
