## Summary

Following your curiosity, you can bring something new and beautiful into the world as a gift to others. But to go there you have to do things that others will think stupid and embarrassing.

## Highlights

- Over the last six months, as I’ve been looking for things that will interest me, I’ve done it coldly. I’ve kept a list of things that makes me say, “Hm. That’s interesting.” That is, I’ve looked for things that match the pattern of how an Interesting Idea is supposed to look. But I’ve forgotten to ask myself what _feels_ interesting, as in, “I can’t explain why, but this car with seventeen headlights is just really fascinating to me.”
- The more general point, then, is: interestingness, the compulsion to know, is not a property of an idea; it is a cluster of emotions. You can’t go looking for interesting _ideas, not_ directly. You have to look for that thing that surges up in you—surges like rage, like laughter, like sadness—when you encounter clues.
- I have fallen for the cardinal sin when looking for interestingness: I’ve wanted what I find interesting to be interesting to others, too.
- (1) It is by following your curiosity that you can bring something new and beautiful into the world as a gift to others. But (2) to go there you have to do things that you fear others will think are stupid or embarrassing.
