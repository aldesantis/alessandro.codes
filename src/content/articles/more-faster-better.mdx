## Summary

The antidote to never feeling done.

## Highlights

- More faster better, or MFB. This is a mental short-hand I use for a value system that’s everywhere around us. In fact, I’d argue it’s not _a_ value system, but _the_ value system we all are born into. The water we swim in.
- When I’m taking care of myself and things are going pretty well, it’s easier for me to see MFB for what it is: a fallacy. To say to it: “No thank you, I’ve tried that way of doing things and I know where it leads, so I’m not taking part in that.” To recognize the fizzy, pulse-quickening sensation it triggers in my body — like I’m gearing up to run a race — and take a big deep breath to counteract it. But when things are stressful, time and money are scarce, expensive things in my flat keep requiring repairs, and when I’m nervous about the future, I sign right up again.
- This is why it’s so important to interrogate the logic of MFB, to stop it in its tracks to the extent that we can. Because even in our wildest financial dreams, we’ll never earn our way out of it.

- Because the only way to slow MFB down is to interrogate the beliefs you hold deep down that make it so powerful. To search for your sense of enough-ness somewhere else. To take a deep breath and allow yourself to momentarily inhabit the belief that right here, right now, you are enough already. To let your entire body soften into that truth, even if just for a moment.
