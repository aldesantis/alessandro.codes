## Summary

The text discusses the danger of always focusing on “What’s next” and never being satisfied with the present. It encourages readers to find joy in the current moment and appreciate what they have now. The author suggests asking reflective questions to shift perspective and prioritize enjoying the journey over constantly striving for the next achievement.

## Highlights

- _Next_ will come in its own time, but _now_ is more important. As a striver and planner, it is hard for me to not keep pushing for more. Learning contentment and peace has been a process. But over the years, I have learned to quiet that constant ambition in favor of seeing the absolute joy in where I am.
