## Summary

The internet’s easy access to information has made cultural arbitrage less valuable, affecting how we share and gain knowledge. As a result, fewer individuals can build identities based on exclusive information, leading to potential losses in cultural innovation and hybridization. The shift towards information equality may require new ways for tastemakers to keep culture moving forward and maintain its value.

## Highlights

- If [financial arbitrage](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/09/arbitrage-in-the-internet-age/245576/) involves the acquisition of commodities in a market where they are inexpensive and selling them for profit in a market where they are expensive, cultural arbitrage is the acquisition of information, goods, or styles in one location where they are common and dispersing them in places where they are rare.
- Cultural arbitrage now happens so frequently and rapidly as to be nearly undetectable, usually with no extraordinary profits going to those responsible for relaying the information.
