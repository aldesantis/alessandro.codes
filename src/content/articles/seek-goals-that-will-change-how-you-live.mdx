## Summary

Defining the right mindset and the strategies to set goals correctly

## Highlights

- A goal aims at the process _within a timeframe_; success aims at the definition of identity and feelings.
- **Define goals that will form habits rather than ones you’ll complete and forget about.** Instead of saying, “I will read 20 books in 2025,” turn it into, “I will read >20 mins a day for 300 days.”
