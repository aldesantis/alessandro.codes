## Summary

The Brand Universe is the inevitable next growth path for brands seeking to increase their cultural relevance and their profits.

## Highlights

- A Brand Universe is a harmonious and interlinked ecosystem of internal (image, attitude, and codes) and external (narrative, entertainment, and product) touchpoints that combine to make a brand or individual distinctive, sought-after, and influential amongst its target audience.
- As demonstrated by brands like A24, Jacquemus, or Rick Owens, the best Brand Universes create a set of cohesive and immersive entry points that resonate with diverse customer segments on both a deeply personal as well as on a collective level. **They are devoted to carefully maintaining the red thread that keeps these activities consistent and inextricably linked to the core of their brand**.
- In other words, brands with a strong Brand Universe understand the importance of loosening the grip on control once a message, a product, or a campaign has launched. They let their output live among culture, yet are never inconsistent.
