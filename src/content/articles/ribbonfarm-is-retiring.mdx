## Summary

Venkatesh Rao is officially retiring his blog, Ribbonfarm, after 17 years of operation. Although he is not retiring personally, he feels it is time for the blog to step back as the landscape of online content has changed. For those who want to continue following his work, he invites them to subscribe to his Substack, which will offer a different style and content.

## Highlights

- Virality as such, is mostly dead as a cultural phenomenon in long-form writing. When it occurs these days, it feels somehow deadening and cheap.
- Where the viral blog post of the last decade was something of a loud public-park pop-music performance, good 2024 longform feels more like chamber music performed for exclusive invite-only audiences.
- A bathtub is no place for ideas that yearn for the ocean.
