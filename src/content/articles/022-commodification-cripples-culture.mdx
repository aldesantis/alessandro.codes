## Summary

The article discusses how the commodification of culture, especially through NFTs, ties art and cultural artifacts closely to their financial value. This focus on price diminishes the true artistic merit and creativity, as creators feel pressured to prioritize commercial success over genuine expression. As a result, the culture around art becomes boring and overly obsessed with profit rather than beauty.

## Highlights

- At the most basic level what this means is anyone with a simple code can see how much is in your digital bank account. But, even more disruptively, it also allows anyone to look at your collection of digital artefacts and see exactly how much you paid for each piece.
  Tack onto this ‘transparency’ the existence of platforms like _OpenSea_, which allow you to see a cultural asset’s _‘floor price’_, ‘_best offer’_, _‘total volume’_ and _‘last sale’_, and each cultural artefact becomes saddled with its own fruit of knowledge, along with a blockchain shaped bite.

- Before the late 20th century the price of a cultural good was determined 1) at time of sale and 2) at periodic points of resale. In both instances, what was and was not sold, and to whom, remained at the seller’s discretion.
  Between 1979 [[1](https://thisoutfitdoesnotexist.substack.com/p/022-commodification-cripples-culture/#footnote-1-152560134)] and 2020 however, the advent of e-commerce resulted in a sharp increase in the **accessibility,** **velocity and transparency** of cultural objects.
- **cultural assets should not be cursed with a permanent price tag, not to mention one that is updated in real-time.** The causes of the ailment don’t just lie in the technologically accelerated dynamics of accessibility, transparency and velocity, formerly discussed, but in the type of consumer that these qualities attract.
