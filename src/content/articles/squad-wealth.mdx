## Summary

Squads, as social and economic groups, are reemerging with the rise of online communication platforms. They prioritize collective well-being over individual success and rely on trust and shared values to thrive. Squads are reshaping social dynamics and creating new forms of community wealth and resilience.

## Highlights

- Squad culture is the antithesis of neoliberal individualism. Millennials are healing from decades of irony poisoning, rediscovering what it’s like to have generative, exploratory relationships with one another. Younger generations are already imbued with extremely powerful squad energy, equipped with formative experiences in Minecraft, DOTA 2, and Fortnite parties.
- Squads are woke to the empty neoliberal promises of [gig-economy "employment](https://onezero.medium.com/the-gig-economy-is-failing-say-hello-to-the-hustle-economy-13ae3aa91954)” and para-social personal brands. Squads value self-determination, not through individualism, but through collective maintenance and care for one another. Squads value creative expression, but celebrate the group rather than individual authorship. For the squad, the autonomous is always collective.
