## Summary

Brands like Jiggy and Waterdrop use loyalty programs not just for discounts but also as a valuable source of feedback and inspiration. By tapping into data from loyalty members, companies can make informed decisions on product offerings, marketing strategies, and customer experiences. Loyalty programs serve as mini-focus groups, offering insights into customer preferences that can drive growth and enhance the overall shopping experience. Utilizing first-party data from loyalty programs has become increasingly crucial for brands in navigating challenges like rising customer acquisition costs and the shift away from third-party cookies.

## Highlights

- While customers are flocking to loyalty programs in the hopes of discounts and free shipping, retailers and brands can also use that first-party data to improve the customer experience and tweak growth strategies.
- “You have to worry about how to offset increases in CAC, and the best way to do that is to find more value in your customer and loyalty is a way to do that,” Smolin said. “If there are no more third-party cookies, brands need to have first-party data more than ever before.”
