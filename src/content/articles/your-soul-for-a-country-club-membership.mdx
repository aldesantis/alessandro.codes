## Summary

Join some of New York's top eCommerce brands at the New York eCommerce Summit, where industry experts will discuss crucial topics such as the Future of eCommerce, Enhancing Operations and Supply Chains, Unlocking Your eCommerce Potential with AI, Navigating Mobile Commerce, Data-Driven eCommerce, Omnichannel and Digital Marketing Strategies.

## Highlights
- Like a middle schooler who just learned how to fart with their hand cupped in their armpit, attention can be earned for next to nothing if you don’t mind trading your dignity.
- Not all friction in the shopping experience is bad. In fact, some friction can be beneficial. Engaging with a cashier, for example, is a form of good friction. It offers a human touchpoint that can enhance customer service, deter theft, and even build brand loyalty through positive interactions.
