## Summary

“Staring into the abyss” means facing uncomfortable thoughts and decisions head-on, which can lead to better life choices. People who excel at this skill, like Drew from Wave, make significant improvements by tackling tough questions directly. Avoiding these difficult topics can block personal growth, so it’s essential to confront them to improve decision-making.

## Highlights

- The same principle applies even more to romantic relationships: past some threshold of compatibility, much of your relationship’s value comes precisely from the fact that the two of you expect to being together for a long time, and can make correspondingly long-term investments in making your relationship awesome.
