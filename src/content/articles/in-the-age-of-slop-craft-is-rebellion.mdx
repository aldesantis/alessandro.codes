## Summary

In a conversation with indie game creator Neal Agarwal, he shares his journey of crafting unique web games and the impact of AI on game development. He emphasizes the importance of creative freedom and standing out in a world filled with hastily made content. Agarwal believes that true art comes from human connection and that the future of indie games can be exciting if it balances creativity with technology.

## Highlights

- When I do feel burned out, it’s usually a sign that something’s off with how I’m spending my time and energy. That’s an important signal to listen to. Your body is telling you something is wrong, it’s trying to help you avoid spending a life on things you don’t enjoy. Burnout isn’t the enemy, it’s just the messenger.
- But the more absorbed you are in any machine, any man-made contraption, the more it takes you away from actual human experience. Humanity is reality. The way I see it, everything we do and every tool we use is on a spectrum of how much it pulls us away from reality, and thus further away from becoming a resilient, adaptable person.
- _What happens when your most important relationship is with a bot, and it’s owned by a company whose only goal is to keep you hooked?_ The perfect AI girlfriend isn’t going to argue back with you.
