## Summary

The text discusses how every company already has a strategy based on its actions, not just what is written down. It suggests focusing on continual improvement rather than striving for a perfect strategy from scratch. By addressing key gaps and making integrated choices for betterment, companies can progress strategically and overcome the status quoâ€™s resistance.

## Highlights

- In addition, by focusing on one gap at a time, betterment makes the strategy problem more tractable, and tractability is often a challenge in strategy. Executive teams can get overwhelmed by the task of creating from scratch a perfect overall strategy. That often feels too daunting and too abstract. Betterment is a more concrete task that makes it easier for executive teams to stay engaged and power through.
