## Summary

Startups rely heavily on luck, but they can improve their chances by focusing on options that allow for multiple paths to success. Instead of needing many factors to succeed together (using “and”), it’s better to create scenarios where only one of many options needs to work (using “or”). This approach increases the likelihood that some elements will align favorably, enhancing the potential for success.

## Highlights

- By accumulating “and” requirements, you are lowering the probability of success. By stringing together possible solutions with “or,” you are increasing the number of ways that luck could smile upon you.
