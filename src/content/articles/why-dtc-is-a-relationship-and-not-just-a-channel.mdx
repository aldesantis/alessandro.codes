## Summary

The executive values his company’s direct relationship with customers, but says it’s all about sales and profits at the end of the day.

## Highlights

- “Direct to consumer for us means a direct-to-consumer relationship, not a channel,” he said. “Long term, I don’t see direct to consumer being viewed as a channel like e-commerce or brick-and-mortar retail. DTC is about the relationship you create with your consumers regardless of the channel you create it through.”
- Lovesac does this by entering into what Nelson called “hybrid partnerships” with wholesalers that require all its product to be sold through pop-up or shop-in-shops (also known as store-within-stores) that ensure the company touches each transaction.
