## Summary

The author discusses how modern culture has become bland and repetitive due to algorithms and risk-averse business practices. To stand out, brands need to embrace creativity and take risks, rather than just producing what is already popular. The challenge lies in balancing originality with the desire for widespread appeal in a competitive market.

## Highlights

- _Feeling cozy in our own taste space is largely responsible for Zara collabs, AI face, Spotify hits, Twister, Shogun and Gladiator reboots._ _Cultural “simplification” appeals to human tendency to revert to the recognizable and the familiar._
- Faulty as they may be, snap judgements overpower decision-making. Processing complexity of any person, choice, or a situation is time consuming and resource-draining. Snap judgements simplify the world. A very few people have the time or the attention to sift through the entirety of culture.
- A hundred years later, in the infinitely more complex production-distribution-talent world, Hollywood remains organized around the same principle of risk-minimization, generating reboots, sequels and franchises - basically, owning IP and monetizing it to death.
  Creative risk-taking is risky for business.
- ON reached scale and popularity through wild product innovation powered by celebrity (originally Roger Federer, now Zendaya, FKA Twigs, etc). Celebrities, like algorithms, are shortcuts. They amplify great product but cannot compensate for a mediocre one.
- No one wants to make things - movies, books, fashion - that only a few people want, so everyone makes things that a lot of people already want.
- In contrast, Nike - once fearlessly creative and contrarian - resorted to making Pandas relentlessly and repeatedly. Pandas were popular; making already popular things is, by default, the opposite of creativity. But what cost Nike more than prolonged lack of creativity is their loss of scale through the wholesale withdrawal. Those Pandas may not have been cool anymore, but they would have still been flying off the shelves if there were stocked on them in the first place.
