## Summary

Apple’s Vision Pro headset is real enough, but it won’t be real for the majority of consumers for many years, if ever.

## Highlights

- Apple’s doing a lot here that’s custom, that’s extremely advanced, and that doesn’t scale affordably given the production methods available now. All of that could change, especially with a robust developer story — something this announcement, and the initial slate of sales of this hardware, are definitely intended to encourage. But all that means that what Apple showed during its [official unveiling today](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/05/a-closer-look-at-apples-3499-vision-pro-headset/) wasn’t an accurate reflection of a reality any of us will know anytime soon; at best it’s a vision likely five years out in terms of true mass market appeal, providing all the pieces fall into place correctly between now and then.
