## Summary

AI is made up of many different models working together, not one all-powerful system. People must still guide and check AI carefully, so it helps them rather than replaces them. AI works best for tasks we can easily see and verify, like images, but struggles with complex things like code or long text.

## Highlights

- This is my major criticism of LLM coding in that they casually spit out _way_ too much code per query at arbitrary complexity, pretending there is no stage 2. Getting that much code is bad and scary. Instead, the LLM has to actively work with you to break down problems into little incremental steps, each more easily verifiable. It has to anticipate the computational work of (2) and reduce it as much as possible. It has to really care.
- AI is practically constrained, because it has to be prompted and verified, and because it does things middle-to-middle rather than end-to-end.
