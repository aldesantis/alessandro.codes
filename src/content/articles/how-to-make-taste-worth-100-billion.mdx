## Summary

The internet mostly feeds us cheap, attention-grabbing “slop” that numbs and distracts. The author proposes building scalable “taste elevators” that teach people to appreciate higher-quality media and charge for that growing taste. These platforms would grow the market by upgrading viewers, not just competing for the same audience.

And it’s gonna get easier and easier, and more and more convenient, and more and more pleasurable, to be alone with images on a screen, given to us by people who do not love us but want our money. Which is all right. In low doses, right? But if that’s the basic main staple of your diet, you’re gonna die. In a meaningful way, you’re going to die.
