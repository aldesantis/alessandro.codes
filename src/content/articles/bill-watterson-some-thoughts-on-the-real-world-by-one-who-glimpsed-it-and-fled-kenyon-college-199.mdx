## Summary

Bill Watterson reflects on his college experience, emphasizing the importance of creativity and play in nurturing happiness and ideas. He warns against letting external pressures dictate one’s life and encourages finding personal meaning beyond societal success. Ultimately, he believes that cultivating interests and inner motivation leads to a more fulfilling life.

## Highlights

- If you ever want to find out just how uninteresting you really are, get a job where the quality and frequency of your thoughts determine your livelihood.
- Our idea of relaxing is all too often to plop down in front of the television set and let its pandering idiocy liquefy our brains. Shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating; the mind is like a car battery-it recharges by running.

- A playful mind is inquisitive, and learning is fun. If you indulge your natural curiosity and retain a sense of fun in new experience, I think you’ll find it functions as a sort of shock absorber for the bumpy road ahead.
- Selling out is usually more a matter of buying in. Sell out, and you’re really buying into someone else’s system of values, rules and rewards.
- To invent your own life’s meaning is not easy, but it’s still allowed, and I think you’ll be happier for the trouble.
