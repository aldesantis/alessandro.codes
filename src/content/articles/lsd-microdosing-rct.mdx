## Summary

A study on LSD microdosing found no significant benefits for mood or creativity. Despite many positive anecdotes, the trial showed concerning negative trends. Overall, the experiment did not support the idea that microdosing improves well-being.

## Highlights

- creativity is a kind of optimization activity like [simulated annealing⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) in which one searches through a vast number of possibilities for the right thing.

- And LSD? Perhaps doses large enough that you become so ‘creative’ that you start seeing what is not there are analogous to turning the temperature up a thousand degrees: the frantic annealing may hit upon some remote undiscovered great idea (eg. PCR) but this will usually just throw away all one’s current good results in favor of some random dreck.
