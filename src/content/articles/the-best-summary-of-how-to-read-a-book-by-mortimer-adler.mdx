## Summary

Mortimer Adler’s “How to Read a Book” explains four levels of reading: for entertainment, to inform, to understand, and to master. Elementary and inspectional reading are key for deciding if a book is worth deeper analysis, followed by analytical reading for understanding and syntopical reading for mastering a subject by comparing various sources. Each level requires different approaches, from skimming to deep analysis, to become a demanding reader who asks critical questions and seeks answers.

## Highlights

- In _How to Read a Book_, Mortimer Adler identifies four levels of reading:
  1. Elementary Reading
  2. Inspectional Reading
  3. Analytical Reading
  4. Syntopical Reading
- Some people think skimming and reading quickly is a bad idea. It’s not.
  The point of a quick skim is to determine if the book is worth reading deeply in the first place. Most are not.
