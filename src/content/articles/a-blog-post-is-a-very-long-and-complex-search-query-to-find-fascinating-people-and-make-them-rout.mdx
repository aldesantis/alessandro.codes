## Summary

The author reflects on how writing online helps connect with like-minded people and share interesting ideas. He believes that precise and clear writing can attract readers who share niche interests. Ultimately, the internet allows for meaningful relationships to form around unique topics, enriching the conversation and knowledge exchange.

## Highlights

- The more precise and niche the words I input, the better the internet would match me with people I could forge meaningful relationships with. This precision was hard for me, partly because my sense for how communication is supposed to work is shaped by reading mass media. Writing for a general public, you need to be broad and a bit bland. I didnâ€™t want a general public. I wanted a specific set of people, the people who could help me along as a human being obsessed with certain intellectual problems.
- The pleasant parts of the internet seemed to be curated by human beings, not algorithms. For my writing to find its way in this netherworld, I needed to have a rough sense of how information flowed down there. The pattern was this: words flowed from the periphery to the centers. This was a surprisingly rapid stream. Then the words cascaded from the center down in a broader but slower stream to the periphery again.
- Having idiosyncratic interests that grow in complexity means that _if you pursue_ _them too far you will end up obsessed with things that no one else around you cares about_.
- A blog post is _a search query_. You write to find your tribe; you write so they will know what kind of fascinating things they should route to your inbox. If you follow common wisdom, you will cut exactly the things that will help you find these people.
- What would have made me jump off my chair if I had read it six months ago (or a week ago, or however fast you write)? If you have figured out something that made you ecstatic, this is what you should write. And you do not dumb it down, because you were not stupid six months ago, you just knew less. You also write with as much useful detail and beauty as you can muster, because that is what you would have wanted.
