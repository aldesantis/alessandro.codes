## Summary

Tommy Hilfiger has successfully maintained relevance in the fashion industry for nearly 40 years by leveraging celebrity connections and designing classic pieces with a modern twist. Founded in 1985 with a focus on menswear, the brand grew rapidly through bold marketing campaigns and strategic partnerships. Over the years, the company expanded into various product categories, gained popularity through celebrity endorsements, and navigated challenges to remain a prominent player in the fashion market. Despite ups and downs, Tommy Hilfiger’s ability to adapt, innovate, and stay true to its core values has contributed to its long-standing success and global recognition.

## Highlights

- “Our main focus is keeping the brand relevant, keeping it eternally youthful, keeping the momentum and spirit very positive but at the same time putting the consumer first always. That has never changed in the 35 years,” Hilfiger said in a WWD interview in 2020.
