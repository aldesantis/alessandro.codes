## Summary

I’ve ranted endlessly about how marketing leaders refuse to invest in hard-to-measure marketing channels like PR, media, native social, events, many types

## Highlights

- All we are certain of is that what’s been lost cannot be restored. We’ve returned to the 20th-century’s marketing measurement systems: a model that demands less certainty, more creativity, and intuition > blind trust in analytics suites. Most businesses just don’t know it yet.

- Almost every business has a competitor (or a handful) that are engaging in hard-to-measure tactics; use those examples to suggest that your brand do likewise before it’s too late.

- One final thing I’ll say that’s often infuriating to marketing practitioners: the absolute best way to do much of this is to give up on tracking, trust your instincts, use directional lift over time, and redirect all the hours of work the above measurement practices require into actual marketing activities.
