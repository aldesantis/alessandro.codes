## Summary

AI has advanced significantly, outperforming humans in tasks like mathematics and programming, raising concerns about job security for many workers. To thrive in a future with AI, focus on skills that are complex and not easily reduced to clear datasets. Those who can leverage AI to enhance their unique abilities will have the most successful careers.

## Highlights

- if your job is legible enough that people can make a dataset clearly pointing out what is right and what is wrong, you are at the highest risk for an AI model being “superhuman” at your job. It is even more risky if it is possible to articulate your thought process in a way that is verifiable.
- Both Tyler Cowen and K share the same trait: their value comes from navigating ambiguous human preferences and synthesizing disparate information in ways that can’t be reduced to clear right or wrong answers. In other words, they have _taste_. Their work resists dataset creation because success is contextual, subjective, and often relies on tacit knowledge that can’t be easily formalized.
