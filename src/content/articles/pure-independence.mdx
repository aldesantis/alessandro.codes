## Summary

Independence, both financial and personal, is essential for a fulfilling life. It allows individuals to pursue their own goals and values without outside influence. True independence leads to less stress and a greater sense of purpose.

## Highlights

- “There is only one success,” says poet Christopher Morley, “to be able to spend your life in your own way.”
- Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are least dangerous is the man of ideas. He is acquainted with ideas, and moves among them like a lion-tamer. Ideas are dangerous, but the man to whom they are most dangerous is the man of no ideas. The man of no ideas will find the first idea fly to his head like wine to the head of a teetotaller.
- If I can predict your views on one topic by hearing your views about another, unrelated topic, you are not thinking independently. Example: If your views on immigration allow someone to accurately predict your views on abortion and gun control, there’s a good chance you’re not thinking independently.
- Independence does not mean you don’t care what anyone thinks of you. It means that you strategically decide whose attention you seek.
