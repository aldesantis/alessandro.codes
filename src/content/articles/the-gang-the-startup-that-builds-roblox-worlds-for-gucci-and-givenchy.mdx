## Summary

The Gang is a startup creating virtual brand worlds on Roblox for fashion labels like Gucci and Givenchy. They focus on interactive experiences tailored to each brand, learning from their own games and user feedback. The company has seen significant growth and is exploring collaborations with young creators on the platform.

## Highlights
- “Roblox users are not after a PR campaign. That’s like watching the commercials instead of the movie,” Holmström says. “Brands may believe that people are just going to come to their Roblox world because they are iconic as a brand. But even if that happens, if it’s not a good experience, they’re going to leave the area and leave a negative review.”
- The opportunities are exceptional for accurate product development, suggests Holmström. “Instead of you creating the only design and pushing it out there, Roblox users will help you design what’s actually cool, just by making their own virtual products,” he says. “It’s like when brands do [focus groups] but virtually, with millions of people, rather than a small test group. You know right away what’s going to fly and what’s not.”
