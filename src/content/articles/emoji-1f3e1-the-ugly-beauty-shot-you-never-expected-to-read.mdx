## Summary

The Saturday before the U. S.

## Highlights

- We’ve all fantasized about escaping reality at one time or another; now it seems to have quietly escaped us. In the absence of an objective reality, not only can we no longer tell the difference between human and artificial intelligence, real and unreal, and truth and fiction, we can also no longer find value in doing so.
- Systems of ugliness—from Vladimir Putin to Viktor Orbán to Trump—will always dress up as a hyper-masculine force. Because they’re run by (men afraid to be) losers.
- If hope dies last, as the saying goes, beauty dies first. Whenever there’s an attack on our humanity—our decency as human beings, our human rights—on the thin and fragile mantle of civilization, beauty is among the first targets. The little extra, the care, the love, the finesse, the meticulousness—they are all anathema to movements designed to dehumanize.
- Make no mistake: This is a political project. There is nothing fluffy or feel-good about beauty. It is the seams of the fabric of civilization. Without beauty, nothing is anything.
- The only way to beat populists is to become more popular than them. We must create a new story, a new alternative reality. We must move beyond enlightenment, beyond the idea of an objective truth, beyond the notion that democracies are held together by educated elites, reason, and facts. We must create the more extravagant fantasies, the more enchanting fictions, the more persuasive delusions. We have no choice but to win the information wars. We must have the better propaganda and the smarter algorithms to spread it.
