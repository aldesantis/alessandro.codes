## Summary

The author argues that much of management theory is ineffective and often serves the interests of the management class rather than workers. He critiques the education process for business leaders, suggesting it focuses on jargon rather than practical knowledge. Ultimately, he calls for a more thoughtful approach to management that considers broader philosophical implications and diverse experiences.

## Highlights

- What they don’t seem to teach you in business school is that “the five forces” and “the seven Cs” and every other generic framework for problem solving are heuristics: they can lead you to solutions, but they cannot make you think.
- M.B.A.s have taken obfuscatory jargon—otherwise known as bullshit—to a level that would have made even the Scholastics blanch.
- In a sense, management theory is what happens to philosophers when you pay them too much.
