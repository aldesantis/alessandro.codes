## Summary

Negative feedback comes from disagreement. When you express a belief that is directly opposed to MY beliefs, I might have a negative emotional reaction.

## Highlights
- Love and hate aren't as far apart as they seem – they both stem from passion. When someone is strongly opposed to something you do or say, it's because they have a strong positive reaction to the opposite.
- Negative feedback isn't the enemy – **indifference is the enemy**.
- *No response* to your content is a death sentence. No response is a signal that people don't care, and if people don't care, there won't be conversation. No attention and no conversation makes the content useless to the individual, the creator, and the algorithm.
