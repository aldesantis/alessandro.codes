## Summary

Critical thinking and practice are needed for good subjective judgment.

Organisations that reserve all discretionary decisions for seniors create bottlenecks and fail succession.

Give juniors low-stakes decision opportunities so they learn judgment and improve real decisions.

## Highlights

- One counterargument is that experienced senior talent can be hired from outside. But these hires lack institutional knowledge about how this specific organisation works: its culture, unwritten rules, stakeholder relationships. External hires often fail precisely because they have judgment skills but lack context to apply them properly. Building internal succession ensures judgment is exercised by people who understand the organisation.
- Discretion is better exercised by those with concrete knowledge of the context. Junior people with more operational remits typically have this concrete contextual knowledge. They are closer to customers, day-to-day operations, ground-level details, implementation realities. Senior people are further removed from operational details and concrete context.
- Good subjective judgment is **only** necessary when you’re trying to do something that isn’t well-understood in advance or where there’s no clear definition of success. (It’s unnecessary when the task is perfectly understood.) This means that all innovation and all strategy work require subjective judgment.
