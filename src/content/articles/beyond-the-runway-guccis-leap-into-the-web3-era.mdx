## Highlights
- Current internet giants monetize user data through targeted advertising, but Web3 proposes a shift in this model. Brands could target users based on the NFTs in their wallets and past interactions with decentralized apps, offering a more intimate customer engagement approach.
- The luxury industryâ€™s foray into Web3 is not just about embracing new technologies; it represents a broader evolution in the concept of luxury itself, where digital exclusivity and virtual experiences become integral to brand identity.
