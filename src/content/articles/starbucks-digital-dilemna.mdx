## Summary

Starbucks faces challenges with declining customer numbers due to issues with their mobile app and store experience. Customers are unhappy with the shift towards prioritizing speed over quality, leading to potential loss of older clientele. To address these concerns, Starbucks may need to revamp its in-store experience and focus on regaining customer loyalty.

## Highlights

- You know those gift cards or loadable consumer apps with like a $3.76 balance that you’ll literally never spend? After a certain period, companies get to claim that is revenue. The accounting term for this is called “breakage”. There were previously three methods used to estimate breakage, but after changes to accounting rules in 2014, Starbucks now use a method based on historical redemption patterns.
- Starbucks went from being a pioneer of mobile app payments to being another F&B option that consumers click on when they swipe open their phones. As the Starbucks business trends more towards digital, countless other independent coffee shops are creating a truly differentiated in-person experience that justifies a premium price.
- The problem with software-based work is that you never know what it does. You can never exhaust what it does. So you can always cover the fact that you haven’t got an idea by trying another option. If you have a lot of options, you don’t usually have a lot of rapport with the instrument. If you have a few options, your rapport keeps increasing because you understand the options better and better. And this is why people still make good music with crude instruments and simple instruments. Because they understand them better than our software.”
