## Summary

An essay from The Work series

## Highlights

- Sarah’s “consumer journey” is really a grief journey. She’s mourning the discovery that western values were always more conditional, more colonial, more cruel than she understood. She’s trying to maintain some sense of agency in systems designed to make agency impossible, and consumption has become one of the few spaces where she feels she has any choice at all.
- Each euphemism transforms human crisis into manageable business variables that can be processed without triggering ethical discomfort or professional inconvenience. We call this strategic thinking.
- The actual critique is that strategic practice has been designed to systematically ignore the human reality behind consumer behaviour. This makes us worse at our jobs - our insights become disconnected from the actual motivations we’re supposed to understand, our strategies miss the real drivers of consumer choice.
- But there’s a crucial difference between political disagreement and moral catastrophe. Legitimate debate over policy approaches - regulatory frameworks, spending priorities, governance structures - enriches democratic discourse. However, when your work involves creating propaganda to make genocide digestible, convincing parents that life-saving vaccines are dangerous, or manufacturing consent for family separation - you’ve crossed from political opinion into something else entirely. Cruelty and dehumanisation rebranded as intellectual sophistication.
- Underneath all the strategic frameworks and consumer insights is an ocean of grief that no one wants to acknowledge, but which shapes every decision people make more than rational preference optimisation ever could.
