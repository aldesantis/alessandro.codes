## Highlights

- If you do mediocre work, no one thinks about you. On the rare occasions when you do great work, people do. You can always earn that right back by doing great work.
- **Appreciate momentum for what it is.** Enjoy it, but know that it’s fickle. Use the opportunities it provides to build something solid. Take profits sometimes.
- **Master all aspects of your craft**. Focus on getting better at the things you can control even when momentum could carry you so that you’re ready when it doesn’t.

- **Stay Weird.** Don’t let mastering your craft make you boring. Use it as a platform off of which you can get even weirder. Business in the back, party in the front.
- Both riding momentum and agonizing over its loss are low-agency moves.
