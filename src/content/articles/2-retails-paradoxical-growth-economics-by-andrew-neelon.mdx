## Highlights

- The reality is that there are factors within the industry, the channel, and even your company that will likely prevent you from achieving those goals. Namely, these stem from a brand’s inevitable needs to do the following 4 things:
  Learn more about 1REC
  Subscribed
  …open more, faster
  …enter malls
  …enter lower tier markets
  …level up and standardize the store experience
- The first few locations were likely in top markets: generally for DTC brands, the larger the market, the more successful a store will be. Put another way, many of the best markets have already been filled. As you go down market tiers, so too will you go down in sales performance (on average). This reflects the diminishing returns of new markets for specialty brands. I’ve never seen this to be non-directionally true for DTC brands.

- There is a fixed and limited amount of opportunistic real estate inventory available: you were able to open your first few locations on the cheap because they were “move-in ready,” but you can only find a few of those per year. If you multiply how many openings you want to achieve in a year, the number of “move-in ready” locations doesn’t also multiply.
