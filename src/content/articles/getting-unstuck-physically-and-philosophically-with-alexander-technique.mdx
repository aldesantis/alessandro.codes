## Summary

The text discusses the Alexander Technique, which aims to help individuals become aware of their habitual movements and expand their possibilities. It emphasizes the importance of not getting stuck in fixed patterns of thinking or movement, and encourages conscious choice-making and openness to change. The technique is linked to philosophy and epistemology.

## Highlights

- Getting stuck means either to forget that you have options or to lack the capacity to act on your options. It means to close yourself off to certain possibilities that exist within your wider ‘_possibility space’._
- Alexander Technique is a way to notice when you’re about to get stuck (to ‘collapse your possibility space’) and then **consciously navigate around getting stuck** or **get unstuck** whenever necessary.
