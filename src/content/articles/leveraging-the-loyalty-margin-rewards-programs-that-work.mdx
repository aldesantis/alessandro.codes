## Summary

Loyalty programs are essential for companies to retain customers and increase profits. The most successful programs use a combination of strategies to drive incremental share and maximize the loyalty margin. Companies should carefully design and track their loyalty programs to ensure they provide real value to customers.

## Highlights

- Loyalty programs began as a tool of the travel industry, in which customer spending is high but the incremental cost of rewards is low. Customers assign a high value to a free hotel room or airline ticket, while travel companies can give these away virtually for nothing so long as the hotel or flight is not sold out.
- Travel companies have high loyalty margins. However, if a retailer gives a price discount, the loyalty margin is narrow to nonexistent. The company invests 5 percent of revenues, for example, in a 5 percent price cut, and the customer values that reward at—you guessed it—5 percent.
- Points provide several attractive benefits for companies, including the ability to pace how quickly customers reach reward levels, the luxury of a floating currency that the company controls, and a simple means for expanding the number of reward mechanisms. Points are particularly helpful in sectors in which the loyalty returns are low, the result of companies giving away tangible goods with real costs.

- When a company is establishing a new program, it cannot yet know what the optimal loyalty margin will be or what incremental share it can achieve. The company should start small enough to limit the downside and minimize the impact of early design mistakes, including a trial period during which it can iron out the economics before scaling up.
