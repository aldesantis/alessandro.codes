## Summary

Running an independent fashion brand is increasingly difficult due to global challenges like raw material shortages and rising costs. Many emerging designers feel unprepared and overwhelmed, often struggling with financial sustainability. The fashion industry needs to rethink its support systems to help these designers thrive rather than just survive.

## Highlights

- Díaz suggests that creatives maintain their risk-taking creative spirit but “think about selling that creativity”, too. Dillane says this approach is his “secret sauce” with KidSuper. “I find the KidSuper in everything I do. Because of that, I can do music videos, art shows, album art, collaborations with clothing and footwear brands,” he explains. “The fan base sees it as us promoting this optimism, mischievousness and creativity, which are the pillars of the KidSuper brand.”
- Experts agree that the gold standard for a great wholesaler is a partner who offers emerging designers at least 30 per cent payment upfront to fund production costs, commits to more than one season of orders (even if they aren’t an immediate success), and strives to avoid seller returns, which put undue risk on independent labels.
