## Summary

The essay discusses how becoming perceptive can lead to self-actualization by helping people see reality more clearly. It highlights that true perceptiveness involves recognizing and questioning our mental models, rather than just accepting what we think we know. Engaging in activities that challenge our understanding can improve our ability to perceive the world accurately.

## Highlights

- If you are confused about your feelings, or in denial about how the world works, or unable to read others, it will be harder to self-actualize.
- _if the prediction error is small, your brain will filter it._ When this happens—when reality seems predictable to you, like what you see is what you expected to see—what you perceive is mostly your predictive model, not reality.
- after a few minutes, people who ask stupid questions tend to sound sharp. They notice things others have missed.
- When you draw, you externalize your mental model of how something looks, and this forces you to admit that you don’t know what a tree looks like, or a hand, or a face. It helps you look closer.
- Following a curriculum, you build mental models by processing simple examples, and then those simple models filter reality so that you become blind to the subtleties of the more complex examples. This is sometimes called a knowledge shield.
