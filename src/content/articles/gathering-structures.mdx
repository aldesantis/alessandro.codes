## Summary

Maggie Appleton shares her experiences in organizing community events and emphasizes the importance of creating spaces for discussion. She encourages others to start their own gatherings by focusing on a few key elements: time, place, intention, and people. Appleton also highlights the challenges of managing larger groups and suggests using tools to facilitate communication and scheduling.

## Highlights

- This question confused me because I’m often trying to get _fewer_ people to come to my events. Not because I don’t like people, but people and problems scale linearly. It is more complex to organise more people. It is harder to find venues, it is harder to coordinate them, and it is more likely one of your participants will be poorly attuned to social norms and behaviours.
- My ideal community size is something like 8-12 people. Enough that if half of you are busy or sick one week, the rest can still hold a lively event.
