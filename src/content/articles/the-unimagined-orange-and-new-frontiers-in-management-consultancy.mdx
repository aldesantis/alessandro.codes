## Summary

The article discusses the concept of ternary plots, which are diagrams that use a triangle to represent three variables. The author provides examples such as citrus fruits, soil types, and potato chips, and notes that ternary plots offer a more nuanced view of a landscape than traditional 2x2 grids. The author also suggests that ternary plots could be a useful tool for businesses in the 21st century.

## Highlights

- Ternary plots seem to promote asking: well what if we could move slightly over there? Where are the tipping points, what’s the terrain? How would we explore this unmapped region?
