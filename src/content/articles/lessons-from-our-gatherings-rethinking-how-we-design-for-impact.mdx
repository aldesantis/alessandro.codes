## Summary

I just returned from a few days in London with my teenage daughter, and one of the highlights of our trip was seeing The Lady from the Sea—a high-octane, modern-day rewrite of Henrik Ibsen’s 1888 play.

- It’s a mistake to think only the “speakers” are on stage. Everyone is. This is true of business events, too: **they are arenas of meaning-making—because the workplace is. They are performative—because work is**. Whether CEO, intern, scientist, or project manager, we are all playing a role.
  The most meaningful gatherings are also, in some way, transgressive. They cross the boundaries upheld by convention just enough to **grant us permission to dream bigger, to step into a different self—and, in doing so, to become more ourselves**.
