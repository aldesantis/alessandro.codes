## Summary

Generative AI is evolving to create “Software with a Soul,” where humanness becomes the main feature, allowing machines to interact like real people. This new technology can scale emotional connections and empathy, opening up opportunities in fields like therapy and education. As AI continues to develop, it will enhance our social interactions and create digital clones that can represent us in various tasks.

## Highlights

- Software with a Soul is, for the first time, allowing us to scale up the “softer” more social parts of human interactions. It’s suddenly possible to program, price and distribute “humanness” like bits, rather than atoms.
