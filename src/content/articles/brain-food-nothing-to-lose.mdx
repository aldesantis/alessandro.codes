## Summary

“If you really want to be great at something, you have to truly care about it. If you want to be great in a particular area, you have to obsess over it.

- There’s a fine balance between obsessing about your craft and being there for your family. It’s akin to walking a tightrope. Your legs are shaky, and you’re trying to find your center. Whenever you lean too far in one direction, you correct your course and end up over leaning in the other direction. So you correct by leaning the other way again. That’s the dance. You can’t achieve greatness by walking a straight line.
