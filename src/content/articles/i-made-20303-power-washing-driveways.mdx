## Summary

Why you’re getting this: this is my Friends Newsletter, a brain dump of interesting things that I send to interesting people I’ve met and friends I want to stay in touch with.

## Highlights

- Every morning at 9AM I get the same Apple Reminder notification.
  ​​
  It pops up on my phone’s home screen (which is always a beautiful photo of my kids).​​
  ​
  It says:​​
  ​*​
  “Invert: How is the stress lucky?”*​​
  ​
  I stop whatever I’m doing and take a second to flip things around and invert. I’m experiencing all this stress because I’m lucky enough to have:​​
  ​
  A vibrant work life full of exciting and interesting businesses.​​
  ​
  Friends who invite me to fun gatherings and hangouts. ​​
  ​
  Two miraculous little boys who want all my attention.​​
  ​
  It never fails to lower my cortisol and make me smile. Try it.
