## Summary

Yann LeCun, Chief AI Scientist at Meta AI, proposes an alternate vision for building human-level AI by allowing machines to learn “world models” in a self-supervised fashion and then use those models to predict, reason, and plan. To achieve this, LeCun proposes an architecture composed of six separate modules, including an autonomous intelligence configurator, perception module, world model module, cost module, actor module, and short-term memory module. The centerpiece of the architecture is the predictive world model, which can learn abstract representations of the world and eliminate irrelevant details to perform predictions. LeCun’s vision requires much deeper exploration than is possible in a brief overview.

## Highlights

- “Human and nonhuman animals seem able to learn enormous amounts of background knowledge about how the world works through observation and through an incomprehensibly small amount of interactions in a task-independent, unsupervised way,” LeCun says. “It can be hypothesized that this accumulated knowledge may constitute the basis for what is often called common sense.”
