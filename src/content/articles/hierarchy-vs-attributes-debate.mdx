## Summary

The article discusses the balance between product hierarchies and attributes in organizing product data. Hierarchies provide structure, while attributes offer flexibility and detail, allowing brands to adapt to changing trends. A thoughtful approach to combining these elements can lead to a more agile and efficient data model.

## Highlights
- To prevent “attribute overload,” brands need a clear, collaborative approach. Establishing a shared attribute “playbook” helps keep definitions consistent, ensuring everyone understands when and how to apply each attribute. This playbook doesn’t just prevent redundant or conflicting tags; it also makes it easier for departments to trust and use product data, no matter where it originates.
- Attributes are not a replacement for hierarchy but a complement. While the hierarchy provides a stable foundation, attributes offer the flexibility to add depth and nuance. When used thoughtfully, attributes allow brands to be responsive and innovative, without sacrificing control over data quality.
- Keeping your hierarchy lean makes it easier to adapt as new trends emerge, preventing the frustration of constantly adjusting rigid categories.
- Develop a shared “attribute playbook” that standardises attribute definitions, spelling, and usage rules. This playbook becomes a reference point, ensuring that all teams tag products consistently and in ways that align with overall business goals. By limiting and standardising attributes, you create a flexible layer of detail that’s manageable, accurate, and easy to use.
