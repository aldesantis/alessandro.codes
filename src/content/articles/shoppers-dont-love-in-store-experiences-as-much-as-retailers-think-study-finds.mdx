## Summary

Many retailers believe shoppers love browsing in stores, but not all consumers agree. Customers want enjoyable and quick shopping experiences, with a blend of online and in-store journeys being preferred. Retailers can improve by listening to customer needs, using analytics tools, and offering innovative services to make the in-store experience more engaging.

## Highlights
- The vast majority, 88%, of retailers believe consumers love to browse stores, but only 69% of consumers agree, according to a [survey of 1,100 consumers](https://www.jumpmind.com/retail-systems-research-rsr-report/) and 100 retailersreleased by Retail Systems Research and Jumpmind last week.
- Retailers overwhelmingly recognize that while most shopping experiences begin online, they end in-store. Most consumers want retailers to enable these journeys; 7 in 10 said they enjoy it when online and in-store experiences blend into one consistent journey.

- Enjoyment and speed are priorities for many shoppers. Nine in 10 consumers want stores to be more fun and easier to navigate, while nearly 7 in 10 want to get in and out of a store as quickly as possible.
