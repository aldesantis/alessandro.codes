## Summary

As Meta and Google costs continue to climb, leading DTC brands are finding smarter ways to connect with customers.

## Highlights

- Smart brands are turning purchase data into product insights. Which bundle combinations drive repeat purchases? Do limited editions convert first-time buyers? Your DTC site holds answers that wholesale relationships simply can’t provide.
- This contextual approach puts products exactly where potential customers are already spending time. Whether in fitness studios, hotel shops, or complementary retailers, physical touchpoints are creating digital conversions that no algorithm adjustment can replicate.
- The most effective retail experiences now combine community building, product education, and brand storytelling. Square footage isn’t just for inventory; it’s for creating the kind of loyalty that withstands market fluctuations.
