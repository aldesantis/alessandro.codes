## Summary

In the digital Agora of the internet, a shift has taken place: the transmutation of Commerce into Media.

## Highlights

- The first and perhaps only rule of the Internet is that on a long enough timeline, everything becomes an ad network.
- While retail media networks can monetize lower funnel search demand and place top of funnel (read: [dumb scale](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gregrizzardi_adtech-ctv-retailmedia-activity-7247398657031868417-Yhzf/)) display ads across the web via audience extensions, most lack access to any inventory that _**actually educates a prospective customer on a product or service**_.
- Before it became the most cliche name for retail SaaS startups, the Agora in ancient Athens was _both the center of commerce and information exchange_ in ancient Greek society.
  Democracy was quite literally born in a bazaar.
- The biggest losers in retail media’s rise are large open web publishers, which relied largely on display ad dollars from large CPG brands (however flawed that business model was).
