## Summary

The newsletter that takes the guesswork out of building and scaling a D2C brand.

## Highlights
- When building your product, some of the things you want to think about from the get-go is:
  1) What is the unboxing experience of getting this product?
  2) Is this product something people would want to put in their homes (like, is the design of the product aesthetically pleasing?) Bonus point: Is it something they would show off?
  3) What is the WOW-Factor of the product and experience?

- Start by understanding who you're selling to, their problems in their day-to-day life, and what they're dreaming about.
  Then figure out how your product fits into those problems and dreams and why they should care to buy from you instead of any other brand.
