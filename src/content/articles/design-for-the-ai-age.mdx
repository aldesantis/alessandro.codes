## Summary

Designing for the AI age requires a shift from traditional, predictable interfaces to more dynamic, conversation-based interactions. This change poses challenges for designers, who must create clear and effective experiences without established paths. A well-structured interface, like a workbench, is essential to guide AI tools and enhance user workflows.

## Highlights

- The design itself establishes this context for both the user and the system. By managing inputs and outputs along structured forms, you minimize the cognitive load required to successfully engage with the product, and minimize the variance in outcomes from that usage.
  Without form, function gets lost. Unbounded AI, much like a river without banks, becomes powerful but directionless. Designers need to build the banks and bring shape to the direction of AIâ€™s potential. But we face a fundamental tension in that AI sort of breaks our usual way of designing things, working back from function, and shaping the form.
- We need to move beyond the generic chat format and reconsider what users truly require for their specific workflows. Without a workbench, we risk wielding powerful tools in empty space.
