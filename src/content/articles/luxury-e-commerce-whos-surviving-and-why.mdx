## Summary

Luxury e-commerce faces challenges, with some players like Mytheresa thriving by focusing on top clients and exclusive products. Survivors like Ssense and Moda Operandi prioritize customer curation and service over discounts, aiming to engage with specific audiences. To succeed in a changing market, e-tailers must articulate their value proposition and adapt to the next generation of shoppers.

## Highlights

- Mytheresa’s engagement with top customers often happens offline. It hosts special events for top clients — a trip to the Italian Riviera with Dolce and Gabbana or a private viewing of a New York Ballet rehearsal, for example — that make them feel like part of an exclusive club. In turn, clients shell out: top shoppers, who typically spend six or more figures on clothes annually, drive nearly 40 percent of the business, [the retailer told BoF in January](https://www.businessoffashion.com/case-studies/luxury/top-one-percent-wealthy-customers-gucci-mytheresa-tiffany/#:~:text=As%20growth%20of%20the%20broader,a%20strategic%20focus%20for%20brands.).
