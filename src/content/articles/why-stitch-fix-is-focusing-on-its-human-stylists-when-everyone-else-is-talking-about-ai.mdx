As it adapts to competition and changes in the market, Stitch Fix aims to deepen relationships between stylists and clients through improved personalization and communication.

- Stitch Fix customers are incentivized to engage by the knowledge that the more they do, the better the results, and **it’s the explicitness of this exchange that makes it so robust and successful**.
