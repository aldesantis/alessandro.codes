## Summary

The zone is flooded. We’re prisoners of the information wars.

## Highlights
- Curation is the holdout in a sea of sameness and mediocrity. **It is the knife that cuts through a world that talks too much, wants too much, consumes too much.**
- The **hard power stems from the curator’s role as a gatekeeper**, deciding who is included and excluded from the conversation. The **soft power is in the ensuing ability to steer the conversation**, set the agenda, and influence public opinion.
