## Summary

How to detect winners early on

## Highlights

- _A brand has fans before it has customers._ A brand that prioritizes organic, community-driven growth versus rapid customer acquisition develops a lasting social influence. One way to kick-start this process is to give consumers a platform and the tools to create influence in their own local communities.
- _A brand pursues the portfolio strategy._ Rather than trying to cater to mass audience in a superficial way, a brand like Netflix goes deep and narrow in pursuit of niche viewers.
- _A brand purpose is generative, not restrictive._ A brand purpose is defined in a way that it does not limit a brand to a specific category, but instead it opens up opportunities for future expansion and cross-market growth.

- _A brand cannot be confused with any other brand._ Companies that operate according to the economics of singularities - like Apple, Aesop, Tesla, Peloton, Uber, Atoms, Caskata - are gradually building their own incomparability. They are not just a representative of their category, they have a cultural identity unto themselves.

- _A brand is part of the balance sheet._ A company understands that it is in the business of cultural creation. A brand unites a company’s business and cultural side.
