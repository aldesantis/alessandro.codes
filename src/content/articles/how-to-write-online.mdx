## Summary

Evan Armstrong shares lessons from his four years of writing online, emphasizing that success comes from understanding your audience and crafting clear, engaging content. He notes that readers often misinterpret writing, so itâ€™s crucial to be clear and repetitive in your main points. Lastly, he believes that writing online should be an act of generosity, aiming to add beauty and truth to the world.

## Highlights

- A merely good piece can get away with containing either a great idea _or_ great sentences. But if you really want to be in the top one percent, you have to be excellent at both sentence-level craft and ideas.
- At some point you just have to acknowledge that everyone has lizard brains. Your task is to embrace it or write work that is so good people overcome their more primal interests.
