## Summary

To activate a cultural program, brands should define their cultural output, operationalize the program with a strategic calendar, and execute it with a detailed rollout plan. This approach helps create a cohesive narrative that connects various cultural initiatives and maximizes their impact. By doing so, brands can enhance their cultural influence and ensure a consistent presence across different platforms.

## Highlights
- When your business depends on cultural currency, best is to create an entire portfolio of cultural output in the hopes that some of it will accumulate enough currency to meet your annual P&L projections. Just like venture capitalists invest in a lot of startups so one of them can make them most of the money, brands create cultural programs so that one output can make up for all the rest.
- There’s an entire playbook of cultural products available to brands, from merch to collaborations to exhibitions and events. The idea is not to deploy them all; the idea is to be strategic. This means using the brand narrative as a filter for the areas of culture that a brand wants to play in / be associated with and selecting cultural products based on the brand and business goals and priorities.
- ***Operationalize*** the program through the cultural calendar (and key moments there), distribution plan, and media amplification. Distribution plan connects brand cultural output in the creative universe: it specifies the links between different cultural outputs, different cultural contexts they will be seeded in, and how they will augment one another.
- Most brands still do not integrate all their cultural actions into one continuous narrative. Instead, each cultural output is treated separately: more advertising than entertainment. This touch-and-go approach leads to brands losing out on the cumulative effect that separate pieces of cultural output (content, merch, collaborations … ) would have had if connected into one interconnected narrative universe.
