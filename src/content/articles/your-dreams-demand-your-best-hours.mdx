## Summary

Your best hours are the times when you feel most alive and creative. We often waste these precious hours on tasks or people that don’t matter to us. To achieve your dreams, you must prioritize and protect your best hours.

## Highlights

- Your best hours are the ones where you feel most alive, most energized, most inspired, most creative—most you. They’re when your focus is sharp, your confidence is high, and your heart is fully in it. You’re the best version of yourself, effortlessly. On an organic drug with no side effects but a fickle half-life.
