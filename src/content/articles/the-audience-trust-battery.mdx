## Summary

I was speaking to a member of The Lab last week about the right time to go “all in” on your creator business (vs. continue working a full-time job).

## Highlights

- Now, imagine that every individual in your audience has an internal “trust battery” that either fills or depletes based on their interactions with you. When you fulfill a promise, the battery fills. When you give to your audience without expectation, the battery fills.
  When you break their trust, have a negative interaction, or get pushy when asking for a sale, you drain that battery.
