## Summary

The text discusses the importance of managing cognitive load in software development to simplify understanding and working with code. It emphasizes reducing complexity and unnecessary dependencies to make projects more maintainable. By focusing on fundamental principles and avoiding high cognitive load, developers can create clearer, simpler, and more maintainable codebases.

## Highlights

- Types of cognitive load
  **Intrinsic** - caused by the inherent difficulty of a task. It can’t be reduced, it’s at the very heart of software development.
  **Extraneous** - created by the way the information is presented. Caused by factors not directly relevant to the task, such as smart author’s quirks. Can be greatly reduced. We will focus on this type of cognitive load.
- It’s enormously difficult to elicit the right logical boundaries in the beginning. The key is to make decisions as late as you can responsibly wait, because that is when you have the most information on which to base the decision.
- The business logic should not reside within a framework; rather, it should use the framework’s components. Put a framework outside of your core logic. Use the framework in a library-like fashion.
