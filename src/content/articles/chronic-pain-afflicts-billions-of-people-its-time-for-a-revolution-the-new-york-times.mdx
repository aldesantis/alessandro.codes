## Summary

Chronic pain affects millions of people and is often misunderstood and neglected by the medical community. Recent research shows that chronic pain can stem from various biological processes, making it a complex issue that requires personalized treatment. There is hope for better understanding and relief as scientists explore new approaches to pain management.

## Highlights

- One big reason chronic pain has been undertreated and shrugged off for decades is that medicine tends to trivialize conditions it lacks the tools to explain.
- And while M.R.I. and f.M.R.I. scans can show changes in the brains of people with chronic pain, those scans are too expensive and cumbersome to work as symptom trackers. “With other diseases, you can measure the size of a tumor or see how much a person’s cortex has shrunk from Alzheimer’s,” Gereau told me. “There’s not something measurable like that for pain. From a research perspective, that’s been a real hurdle.”
- Unlike a broken arm, which gets better, or tendinitis, which hurts mostly in response to overuse, chronic pain makes your whole world shrink. It’s harder to work, and to exercise, and even to do the many smaller things that make life rewarding and rich.
- A cruel Catch-22 around chronic pain is that it often leads to anxiety and depression, both of which can make pain worse.
- Women are more likely to develop chronic pain conditions, possibly because, as Veasley noted, they’re at higher risk for autoimmune disorders, and because hormonal fluctuations can aggravate pain.

- On top of that, many doctors simply don’t like chronic pain patients, whom they often see as demanding and frustrating: an unsolvable problem they quickly tire of.
