## Summary

Deliberate practice is a method proposed by Anders Ericsson, suggesting that focused and challenging practice can lead to expert performance in any skill. However, there are criticisms of this idea, including inconsistencies in definitions and the challenges of applying it in fields without established training methods. While deliberate practice can be effective, it requires careful planning and guidance to truly improve skills.

## Highlights

- For what it’s worth, I find the assertion that Ericsson’s critics level against him a lot more believable: at the highest levels of performance, genetics and innate factors matter because everyone is practicing the same amount; in other fields and at lower levels of performance a combination of genetics, opportunities, and environment affect individual performance just as much as the number of hours spent in effective practice.
- Practice that makes you better should take maximal effort, and thus feel terribly unpleasant to do.
- Purposeful practice requires feedback, and adjustments to technique after getting the feedback.
