## Summary

Agency insiders tell us their predictions for creativity.

## Highlights

- A rash of recent data indicates that consumers are looking for brands that use humor, with a recent Oracle study finding that 91% of people prefer brands to be funny. Yet the same study found that 95% of business leaders fear humor in consumer interactions.
- Audiences are demanding authenticity in their messaging and are cringing at tone-deaf stories. Gone are the days when brands could get away with only talking about themselves, their products or their services.
- Cultural fluency is the best investment for your brand in and through 2024. While the approach I propose may be a case of “what’s old is new again,” perceiving culture as a network of values, conventions and social practices supports the basic principle of understanding your customer communities better.
- We will move into a new era of the creator economy, one in which creators have much more leverage when it comes to usage rights, IP ownership and pay—a world where creators are highly valued, not leveraged for the relationship they’ve built with their audiences, but invited to collaborate for their diverse perspectives, expertise and cultural lens.
- Brands are seeking to streamline and consolidate agency services and relationships. The pendulum has unquestionably swung away from agency specialization back to more of a one-point of contact to drive activity across the marketing communications spectrum and audience journey.
