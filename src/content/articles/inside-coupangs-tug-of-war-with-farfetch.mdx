## Summary

Coupang is trying to make Farfetch profitable by cutting costs, but this is damaging its luxury image. They have stopped allowing top brands to control pricing, leading to some luxury labels withdrawing their products. As a result, Farfetch is struggling to maintain relationships with both customers and luxury brands.

## Highlights
- A retailer’s willingness to nurture its relationships with brands can directly impact its growth. Mytheresa, for instance, has seen a consistent uptick in sales by creating exclusive capsule collections with high-profile brands like Gucci, Saint Laurent and Loewe.
