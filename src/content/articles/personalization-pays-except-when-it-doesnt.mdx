## Summary

Personalization can lead to increased purchases, with consumers more likely to buy more or pay a premium after personalized interactions. However, over half of customers feel overwhelmed or rushed by these tactics, leading to negative experiences. To improve personalization, companies should use active methods that ask customers for their preferences instead of making assumptions.

## Highlights

- Consumers who reported personalized interactions with a brand were 2.8 times more likely to feel time pressure to move forward with a purchase than those who did not have personalized interactions.
  They were twice as likely to feel overwhelmed by the volume of information they received, 1.7 times more likely to delay or put off important decisions, and 3.2 times more likely to regret purchasing a product or service.
- Instead of relying on passive personalization by which marketers gather first and third-party data and infer customer context, Gartner recommends active personalization by directly asking customers to self-identify and clarify their context.
  Consumers find active personalization less creepy and are 2.3 times more likely to confidently complete critical purchase decisions, according to Gartner.
