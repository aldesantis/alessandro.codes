## Summary

OpenAI’s Instant Checkout feature turns ChatGPT into a direct and instant threat to Amazon’s most profitable business segment as it launches what will almost certainly be a billion-dollar GMV marketplace shortly after launching.

## Highlights

- However, transaction volume overlooks a bigger threat. Amazon sellers [paid $56.2 billion in advertising in 2024](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/stats/amazon-advertising-services-sales), and the global adoption of ChatGPT offers sellers something Amazon stopped providing years ago: organic, unpaid product discovery.
- Where Amazon search rewards keyword optimization and bidding, chat-based shopping enables contextual queries. A shopper describing specific needs across multiple sentences surfaces niche products unreachable through keyword matching. This benefits both shoppers, by helping them find more relevant products, and sellers, by allowing their unique product solutions to gain discovery without ad spend – at least not yet.
