## Summary

If you’re going to go through the pain of building a consumer brand, you should start out knowing that this is likely a ~10-year investment of your time, especially if you want to build something bigger than $50-$100M in revenue.

## Highlights

- **Brand Health Checklist**
  1. High Gross Margin
  2. Low OpEx: \<15%
  3. Cash Conversion Cycle
  4. First-Order Profitability
  5. High Lifetime Value
  6. Strong Organic Demand
  7. Great Product
  8. Large TAM
- As hard as it is to accept, LTV is far more determined by the nature of your product itself than “retention” tactics.
- The ecommerce industry as a whole is at a precarious stage in the lifecycle for paid ad platforms. They’re getting insanely expensive, we’re over-reliant, and most consumer goods categories don’t have the margins to win the game.
