## Summary

The book “Make Your Own Job” by Erik Baker explores how the entrepreneurial work ethic has shaped American attitudes toward work and personal fulfillment. It argues that this focus on individualism and competition arose from economic instability and the desire for meaningful jobs. Baker highlights the shift from a traditional industrious work ethic to today’s entrepreneurial mindset, which often leads to precarious job conditions.

## Highlights

- In 1949, Drucker wrote a column for _Fortune_ in which he claimed that entrepreneurialism was a matter of “national interest.” He believed that corporations fulfilled a crucial political function: entrepreneurial managers could foster a sense of citizenship and national responsibility in their subordinates. Entrepreneurship, it would follow, was practically patriotic, a bulwark against authoritarian and totalitarian ways.
