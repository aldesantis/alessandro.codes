## Summary

As paid marketing on Meta gets cheaper and easier to target customers, brands are getting more strategic about the content that attracts consumers at different points in their shopping journey.

## Highlights

- The number of customers who click on Facebook and Instagram ads grew 14 percent year-over-year in the first five months of 2025, while the cost for each of those clicks dropped 10 percent during the same period, according to marketing agency Belardi Wong.
- “If you looked at Instagram a few years ago and just Meta ads in general, it used to be like, how do you figure out your targeting to make sure that you target the right audience,” said Emanuel Cinca, founder and chief executive of the Stacked Marketer newsletter. “It’s changed in the past year or so, where almost 80/20 percent of the performance is given by how good your creatives are.”
- “We’ve done that in the past … where 1,000 people would post the same thing on the same day,” said Vicky Boudreau, founder of micro-influencer platform Heylist. “Now if you do a campaign asking everybody to post the same messaging within the same format, it looks super staged.”
- Brands are learning when to push product-specific imagery — whether flat-lay product images or e-commerce product shots — which were once known to clog users’ feeds but can be effective at converting shoppers who are already familiar with a brand.
