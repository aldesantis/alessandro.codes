## Summary

AI advancements are leading to the obsolescence of many jobs, raising questions about the future of work and happiness. Studies show that unemployment can have negative effects on mental and physical health, but how people use their time during unemployment can impact well-being positively. The shift towards automation may require a reevaluation of societal norms around work and leisure.

## Highlights

- Many will point out that AI systems are not yet writing award-winning books, let alone patenting inventions. But most of us also donâ€™t do these things.
- The economically and politically relevant comparison on most tasks is not whether the language model is better than the best human, it is whether they are better than the human who would otherwise do that task.
