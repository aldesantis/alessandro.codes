## Summary

The text discusses the concept of finding and being your “cool self” in life, which involves being authentic, confident, calm, and original. It emphasizes the importance of choosing your own version of cool rather than conforming to societal standards, and suggests that being your cool self leads to better relationships, personal fulfillment, and success. The theory of the cool self encourages individuals to embrace their true selves, pursue their passions authentically, and prioritize inner fulfillment over external validation.

## Highlights

- _Life is about finding your cool self and then living as much of it as you can being that person_.
- cool means being _authentic, confident, calm, and original_.
- Cool is also something _you feel about yourself_. There are times I feel cool, and there are times I definitely do not. Cool is as much a matter of self-identity as it is of projection.
- Inner cool is closer to self-worth and self-actualization; outer cool is a never-ending game of belonging and status. Ideally, you want to focus on cultivating the inner cool, make it spill over into the outer cool, and live in that state of being as much as you can.
- Loving someone is arguably thinking they are one of the coolest people you know, if not _the coolest,_ just for being _themself_.
