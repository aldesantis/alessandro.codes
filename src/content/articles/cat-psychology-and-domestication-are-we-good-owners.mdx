## Summary

The author reflects on cat behavior and psychology, highlighting that cats face challenges in their domesticated lives. He emphasizes that while cats may seem aggressive at times, this behavior is rooted in their hunting instincts, which can be triggered by human actions. Ultimately, he believes that humans are responsible for understanding and accommodating these natural instincts in cats.

## Highlights

- Given the tail’s role and distance, and how personal identity works, it seems entirely possible that a cat doesn’t quite ‘own’ its tail the way it does more tightly-integrated limbs like its forepaws, and genuinely can be surprised by what its tail ‘decides’ to do.
- A cat without any human contact before 10 weeks will be near-feral (except in the case of severe trauma, apparently, where it may bond with its rescuer, analogous perhaps with “hitting bottom”).
- the widespread adoption of early neutering by the most responsible cat owners risks pushing the domestic cat’s genetics back gradually toward the wild, away from their current domesticated state.
- We suggest that object play by adult cats is controlled by two mechanisms derived from predatory behavior: one responds to prey-like stimulus characteristics, such as texture and small size, which elicit play, while the second detects change in the toy. The behavioral default towards any object is initial interest if it possesses relevant stimulus characteristics, followed by rapid habituation unless these stimulus characteristics change.
- The fourth mechanism is the source of the cat’s apparent frustration: if all that biting and clawing doesn’t seem to have any effect on its target, then either the target wasn’t a meal, or if it is prey, then it’s proving difficult to subdue. A toy that starts to disintegrate, or is taken away but looks different when it comes back (as in our original experiment), mimics the early stages of a kill, thus encouraging the cat to persist.
- Why do cats & dogs eat grass or other plants, and occasionally barf? (My cat does this so regularly that I keep an eye out when I note him eating grass outside, lest he barf on my keyboard/monitor from his perch.) Are they sick, or their diet nutritionally-deficient? The best theory so far is that it’s simply [a parasite prophylactic⁠](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoopharmacognosy): leaves & grass help physically push any intestinal worms out.
