## Summary

Zoe Scaman critiques the superficiality of "woke washing" in marketing, emphasizing the need for brands to engage with social issues more thoughtfully. She argues that brands have significant cultural influence and can drive meaningful change while still pursuing profit. Instead of retreating from activism, brands should find a balance between commercial goals and genuine social impact through what she calls "Influence Architecture."

- Brands will collectively spend over $1.07 trillion on advertising this year. That's more than the GDP of 175 countries. That's cultural influence at a scale that most activists can only dream about.
  They employ millions of creatives, strategists, and media experts whose job is literally to shift perception and behaviour. That's an army of skilled persuaders who could be deployed toward something more meaningful than selling more shit.
  They own the algorithmic attention of billions. Every feed, timeline, and homepage, all saturated with brand messages. That's unparalleled access to eyeballs and minds.
  They're not just commercial entities. They're among our most powerful cultural participants. And when they deploy that power thoughtfully, it matters.
- There's a spectrum between full-blown activism (unrealistic) and complete retreat (a missed opportunity). A space where brands acknowledge both their limitations and their unique position to amplify and support. Where they contribute through consistent action rather than opportunistic messaging. Where they see themselves as accomplices rather than saviours.
- The brilliance is that these profit-driven decisions can simultaneously shift culture. We need to remove the wishful thinking when we approach this stuff. We can have values, but our values need a business case. The strongest Influence Architecture happens when the profit motive and social impact align rather than compete.
    - Note: Purpose needs to be activated!
