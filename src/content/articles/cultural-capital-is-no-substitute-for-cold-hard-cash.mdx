## Summary

The rich used to eat, dress, and even speak entirely differently from the masses. Today they wear T-shirts and sneakers just like the rest of us. But that doesn’t mean we’re all equal. It only lays bare the real source of inequality: actual money.

## Highlights

- With elites jettisoning exclusive markers of “good taste” for a more liberal, pluralistic conception of beauty and authenticity — not to mention a spate of speedy manufacturers gamely mimicking everything from Balenciaga handbags to Supreme hoodies at affordable prices — the task of affecting privilege has lost some of the difficulty that made Highsmith’s drama so compelling.
- Whatever the pros and cons of rigid cultural signifiers, _Status and Culture_ makes one thing clear: good taste is on its way out. The rich don’t eat, dress, or speak as though they belong to an entirely different culture anymore.
- But if it’s even possible for “respect” to be more broadly distributed, what exactly does that mean for a person lacking economic security? Democratizing symbols is a far cry from democratizing society itself.
- If anything, when we appear more equal because we consume the same types of brands, media, and experiences, it distracts us from the startling reality that we are living drastically unequal economic lives.
- Over the decades, I’ve had plenty of time and several occasions to ask whether the nonmonetary clout I’ve accrued is really on par with cold, hard cash or a handsome trust fund. In terms of feeling equal in status and opportunities, I’ve found that it doesn’t even come close.
- Could my own pursuit of cultural capital ever be separated from my desire to distinguish myself from my peers and, along the way, pave the way for upward mobility — that is, to parlay status symbols into status itself?
- No amount of cosmopolitanism or cultural savvy can boost mobility if one doesn’t first have a way to pay their bills.
- One can only be permitted to do or be something if it is legal; it is only possible to do or be something if one has the economic means to carry it out. No amount of cosmopolitanism or cultural savvy can boost mobility if one doesn’t first have a way to pay their bills. Equal distribution of “status” in abstract terms won’t fix that.
- As much as a nuanced grasp of status signals might help us understand the desires of one group or individual versus another — along with our own — it’s far less mandatory than implementing structural policies that prioritize access to basic social goods like housing, health care, and good jobs.
