## Summary

Digital Product Passport (DPP) makes information about a product’s sustainability available to various stakeholders.

## Highlights

- a DPP provides a collection of information about a particular product. Details can include:
  - ingredients or components used in the product
  - sustainability and circularity considerations
  - strategies or metrics for reusability and recyclability
  - repairability, durability, and upgradability considerations
  - energy efficiency metrics
  - compliance data used to establish environmental, etc. status
- • Energy and material efficiency become enhanced by the better quality of information. More robust product data encourages a prolonged life cycle, an optimized active phase, and better options for the product’s [end-of-life phase](https://getenviropass.com/life-cycle-assessment/).
  - Consumers can more easily identify “greenwashing” (presenting a product as more environmentally friendly than it truly is). Users can thus make better-informed decisions about the products they buy and whether those products will perform sustainably.
