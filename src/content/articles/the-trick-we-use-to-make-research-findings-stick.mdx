## Summary

There are some specific biases that come into play when we see or hear new information. We came up with a trick at Monzo to get around them…

## Highlights

- When people aren’t heavily involved in research, they tend not to internalise or fully understand the knowledge as well as people who take part in either collecting it or analysing it. It’s a syndrome of a cognitive bias called the [empathy gap.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy_gap)
  It’s one of the reasons that [research needs to be a team sport](https://userresearch.blog.gov.uk/category/team-sport/), because it’s not as useful or impactful when it happens in a vacuum outside of the team and you share it later.
