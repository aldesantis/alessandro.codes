## Summary

Here’s the paradox: fragility plus daily care outlasts strength plus neglect. The cast-iron pan seasoned daily outlives the new nonstick.

## Highlights

- You can only optimize so much, but you can care forever. Efficiency has limits, devotion doesn’t.
- Entire careers are built managing unnecessary mass. But this is the opportunity. While everyone else adds mass to the system, removing it creates an unfair advantage. The lighter you are, the faster you move.
- When you get in situations where you cannot afford to make a mistake, it’s very hard to do the right thing. So if you’re trying to do the right thing, the right thing might be to eliminate the cost of making a mistake rather than try to guess what’s right.”
