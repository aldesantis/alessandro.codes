## Summary

Retail success now hinges on offering high-quality products at accessible prices, driven by new influencers and content creators. Brands must focus on merchandising and creating a strong narrative to connect with niche audiences, rather than relying on traditional marketing. The modern retail experience should prioritize entertainment, community, and cultural engagement to resonate with consumers.

## Highlights

- The new rule of retail (and something surprisingly obvious): good quality at accessible price sells, powered by the new gatekeepers, affiliates, and fashion Substack whose entire job is to tell you what to buy, where, and how much to spend on it.
- In visual culture, everything eventually becomes image. It doesn’t matter if we own something as long as we photograph it (or use AI to make it). Consumers participate in aspirational culture without participating in the aspirational market. Purchase is not necessary. Dupes are at all times high, with online communities ranking them based to their proximity to the original.

- Wirkin was so successful, it sold out immediately, never to come back again (instead, Walmart inked a deal with second-hand resellers, opting for vintage Birkins instead).
- Implication for fashion retail is to make their products as desirable and discoverable as possible, through design and merchandising. In meme culture, think of your products as potential memes. ⁠
- Beyond image-sharing, brands are seriously getting into the long-form content game, with Sephora launching “Faces of Music,” a three-part Hulu docuseries, with Chappen Roan. Saint Laurent produced and is all over Emilia Perez, an Oscar favorite, and 22 Montagne and Iron Waffle Entertainment were well documented as production arms of LVMH and Nike, respectively.

- In retail business, product is the single most important economic unit. If the product is not great, no amount of brand aesthetic, marketing, influencer strategy, retail experience or PR is going to make it better.
- Hero products are a fodder for collaborations, content engines, and a bridge between the brand heritage and its future. Define what your brand is going to be known for and recognized in culture (Rhode peptide lip treatment, ON’s Cloudlit).
- Merchandising is becoming an experiment, where product ideas are tested in the real world, where they live or die. In this context, it is imperative to have a lot of ideas versus one big idea, and capture many wear scenarios and moments rather than just one moment.
- Hype belongs to a previous era, where it was able to take its time to spread, grow within a community, and spill over into the mainstream. Hype is still there, but as ephemeral and amorphous and short lived as vibes. Spectacle holds the attention monopoly, even if it is consumed through content snippets, memes, and moments.
- Entertainment, community and curation - not heavily branded experiences or long checkout paths - are the blueprint of modern commerce. Modern commerce is more like the digital version of going to a mall than scrolling through products on an e-commerce site. Modern commerce is rich in serendipity, product discovery, socializing, and entertainment. It looks more like a leisure activity than a transactional exchange that’s been over-optimized.
