## Summary

If I want to be an involved and committed father, then I’m not going to be great at video games or golf.

## Highlights

- The easiest way to avoid excellence is to devote a little bit of time to a bunch of disparate pursuits.​
- When you become skilled at quitting, your persistence becomes a superpower.
  Quit the stuff that doesn’t matter. Quit quickly. Quit without guilt.
  If you aren’t afraid of quitting, it will make you much more willing to experiment and try new things.
