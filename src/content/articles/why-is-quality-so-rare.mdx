## Summary

Quality in creation is becoming rare because many prioritize speed and cost over craftsmanship. Despite advances in technology, true craftsmanship requires care and attention, which are often lost in mass production. Choosing to focus on quality can lead to better products and stronger connections with customers.

## Highlights

- We replaced purpose with metrics. If it didn’t move a metric, it didn’t matter. Even we, as designers, stopped asking; “Does this feel right?.” Instead, we started asking: “Does it convert?”
- Craft exists naturally at the beginning. Then technology comes along and makes it easier or quicker to create things, and so we’re pulled away from craftsmanship. But then we start to miss it (in our work and the products we buy) and in response we seek quality, which causes a revival of craft.
- With each prompt, we’re trying to outsource not just labor, but the craft itself — the thinking, the intuition, the care. Yet craft, by its nature, can never be fully outsourced. The qualities that make something truly excellent come from being deeply involved in the entire process.
- Technology makes it faster to build, but harder to care.
