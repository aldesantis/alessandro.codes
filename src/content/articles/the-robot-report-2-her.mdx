## Summary

The text discusses using music to aid writing and the impact of AI models like ChatGPT on human interactions and problem-solving. It contrasts the search experience between Google and ChatGPT, emphasizing the conversational nature of AI. Additionally, it reflects on the potential benefits and consequences of advanced technology, drawing parallels to the movie “Her.”

## Highlights

- Comparing Google and ChatGPT is not a fair comparison. It’s comparing a search engine to a large language model. Two vastly different stacks of technology. Guess what, it doesn’t matter. Your average human is searching for the lowest possible friction means to get the highest possible quality answer.

- Yes, ChatGPT is aggressive and confident even when it’s impressively wrong. Guess what? That makes it more human than robot.
- Technology is magic when it meets our expectations and reflects our reality. When you touch and drag a screen, you expect it to react precisely as when you perform the same actions in the real world.
