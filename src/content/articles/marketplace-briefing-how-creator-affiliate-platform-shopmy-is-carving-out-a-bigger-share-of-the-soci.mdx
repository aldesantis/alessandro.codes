## Summary

ShopMy is a new startup focused on influencer monetization in affiliate marketing. It recently raised $77.5 million in funding to expand its platform for brands and creators. The company is rapidly growing and entering new markets.

## Highlights

- One big focus is making influencer collaborations more programmatic. Right now, affiliate marketing can be unpredictable for brands because it’s mostly passive—creators post, and brands wait to see what happens. We’re building tools that allow brands to proactively invest in top-performing influencers through bonuses and commissions, making the entire process smoother and more scalable.
