## Summary

The article discusses the wealth and power of Silicon Valleyâ€™s richest individuals and their beliefs about Artificial Intelligence (AI). It highlights how some members of this group have become politically conservative and veered into discredited ideologies. The author also criticizes the ways AI is currently being used and the low-quality products generated by AI algorithms on platforms like Amazon. The article questions the motives and attitudes of these wealthy individuals and suggests that their isolation and disregard for the rest of humanity contribute to their distorted perspectives.

## Highlights

- The greed and shortsightedness of contemporary capital are eroding social capacity everywhere; AI, which is a way to make some basic and important things much cheaper and much worse, fits into this in various ominous and obvious ways.
