## Summary

The author believes that agency can be developed, and is not an inherent trait. She has compensated for her aging and perceived lack of intelligence by increasing her agency, which she defines as "manifest determination to make things happen." The author suggests several ways to increase agency, including asking for things, seeking real feedback, increasing the surface area for luck, assuming everything is learnable, learning to love the moat of low status, and not working too hard. The author argues that agency is a skill that can be learned and intensified, and can be applied to many areas of life.

## Highlights
- In my way of thinking, radical agency is about finding real edges: things you are willing to do that others aren’t, often because they’re annoying or unpleasant. These don’t always surface in awareness to the point one is actually *choosing* -- often they live in a cloud of aversion that strategically obscures the tradeoff.

    - Note: To an extent, you should *force* yourself to do things that others aren't willing to do. At the same time, however, you also want to lean into things that you're naturally suited for, while others aren't. In my case, for instance, that's long-form writing/deep thinking.
- Ask for things. Ask for things that feel *unreasonable*, to make sure your intuitions about what’s reasonable are accurate (of course, try not to be a jerk in the process). If you’re only asking for things you get, you’re not aiming high enough.
- What I discovered by casting a wide net was that I have very little ability to predict how useful a call will be in advance. Relevance is easier to predict, but it’s not a very good proxy for usefulness, which is a product of lots of other things including the other person’s enthusiasm and the breadth of their interests.
- Most subject matter is learnable, even stuff that seems really hard. But beyond that, many (most?) traits that people treat as fixed are actually quite malleable if you (1) believe they are and (2) put the same kind of work into learning them as you would anything else.

- making changes in your life, especially when learning new skill sets, requires you to cross a moat of low status, a period of time where you are actually bad at the thing or fail to know things that are obvious to other people.
- Burnout is the ultimate agency-killer. This is so true that I’ve learned to identify a reduction in agency as one of the first signs of burnout, one that shows up even before I consciously realize what’s happening.
