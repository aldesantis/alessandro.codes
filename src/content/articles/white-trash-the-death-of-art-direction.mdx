## Summary

Fashion campaigns are losing their creativity, shifting from vibrant, unique visuals to bland, minimalistic designs. This change has led to a decline in the role of art directors, who are now often sidelined in favor of profit-driven strategies. As a result, consumers are left with unremarkable content that lacks the artistry and storytelling once inherent in luxury fashion advertising.

## Highlights

- What’s left is an oversaturated market for camera-wielding creatives who confidently achieve very _mid_ image making, but there are far, far less who can push beyond that and deliver something _premium_, something that surprises the client (or even the customer), and which is just undeniably special.
- I feel like part of the problem is the world we live in hardly has any reason for us to dress in this wild, extravagant way. All we do is work, maybe work out, catch a casual social gathering but we hardly have a reason to wear something more than casual.
