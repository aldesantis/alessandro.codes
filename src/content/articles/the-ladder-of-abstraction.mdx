## Summary

The Ladder of Abstraction is a technique that helps designers understand complex systems by moving between different levels of abstraction. By stepping up or down this ladder, they can discover high-level patterns and explore specific details of the system. This process enhances their intuition and allows for better control and understanding of how various parameters influence the systemâ€™s behavior.

## Highlights

- the most powerful way to gain insight into a system is by _moving between levels of abstraction_.
