## Summary

Electronic markets facilitate new opportunities for retailers, producers, and consumers through automated transactions. They can lower coordination costs and eliminate intermediaries, reshaping traditional value chains. Disintermediation and reintermediation are key concepts in the evolution of electronic markets.

## Highlights

- Reintermediation is necessary or nothing happens within an electronic commerce (EC) context. In that sense one might argue that the middle person is not dead per se, as was predicted somewhat naively in the early days ofEC by such global information and information technology (IT) research and advisory firms as GartnerGroup and others, yet one must realize that these reintermediaries are often very different players from the original intermediators.
