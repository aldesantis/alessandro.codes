## Summary

Cultural influence comes from social and economic contexts, not just from hiring celebrities or influencers. Trends become popular when the right cultural mood exists, like shared interests and values within communities. Brands succeed by connecting with subcultures and creating meaningful cultural products, not just by chasing fame.

## Highlights

- Celebrities are like mass media, so their audience doesn’t necessarily translate into customers and reach doesn’t always equal influence. They are best used for awareness, with CPM as the core metric, and best is to accept that you’d never know which part of your budget is wasted.
- Nothing is more popular than the already popular stuff.
- Aspirational consumption, motor behind the rise in luxury spending in the early 2020’s, in on hold. Aspirational consumers redirected their spending towards smaller, more affordable items: if they can’t spend money on an expensive bag, they can own a bag charm. If they can’t buy a new item on clothing, they can splurge on a plush toy: the dopamine hit and status signaling is the same.
