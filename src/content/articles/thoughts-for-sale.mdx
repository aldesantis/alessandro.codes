## Summary

Substack is changing how we think about intellectualism by transforming writers into entrepreneurs and newsletters into status symbols. While it aims to make thoughtful media accessible to everyone, the shift towards viral content risks diluting its original appeal. Ultimately, Substack’s success hinges on balancing depth and scale while maintaining a direct connection between creators and their audiences.

## Highlights

- Substack sells intellectual taste as cultural currency and contemporary belonging.
- But, in reality, the best writers—on Substack or anywhere else—aren’t just creators of content; they’re mirrors for aspiration, revealing something readers feel, think, or want to become.
