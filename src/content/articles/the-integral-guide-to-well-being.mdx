## Summary

Rest and restoration are essential for our well-being, allowing us to pause effort and replenish our energy. Taking time to rest helps us reconnect with ourselves and notice what truly nourishes us, rather than just what entertains us. In a fast-paced world, creating space for silence and non-stimulation is crucial for creativity and self-awareness.

## Highlights

- Rest isn’t just sleep, it’s giving ourselves permission to pause effort. To not force an answer. To not rush to fix, solve, change, or to become something other than what you are right now. It’s setting everything down, not engaging in any physical, mental, or emotional productivity.
- Notice what leaves you feeling more like yourself. Even if just a little.
