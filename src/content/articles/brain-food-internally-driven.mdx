## Summary

â€œI think one thing that is a really important thing to strive for is being internally driven, being driven to compete with yourself, not with other people.

## Highlights

- If you want to get rich quickly, the biggest factor is luck.
  If you want to get rich eventually, the biggest factor is consistency.
- Long-term thinking eliminates a lot of poor behavior.
