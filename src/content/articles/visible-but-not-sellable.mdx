## Summary

Retailers often remove out-of-stock products from their websites, missing out on potential sales opportunities. Keeping product pages visible even when items are out of stock can improve customer experience, SEO, and overall business success. Separating visibility from sellability is key for maximizing online sales potential.

## Highlights

- The practice of unpublishing [out-of-stock](https://commercefordevs.org/out-of-stock/) products is very common. This is actually the standard behavior for many ecommerce sites. However, I do not understand the value of this choice. **When a product runs out of stock, displaying its page on the website opens up many business opportunities that would otherwise be lost if the page was removed.**
