## Summary

Welcome everyone to another addition of Cocktails & Commerce.

## Highlights

- In my mind, the MACH Alliance has achieved something very meaningful - it lit a fire under a stagnating market while mainstreaming and advancing key architectural concepts like ‘API-first’, ‘composability’, and ‘headless’ across the market.
- In my mind, the yawns the Alliance has largely received in the U.S. have less to do with a lack of technical understanding on the part of the business - U.S. enterprise commerce leaders are relatively technically savvy - and more to do with risk and the focus these leaders have on business impact and the outcomes they want to see in any new solutions or larger technology transformations.
