## Summary

Influencers and their content, not brands, drive shopping on TikTok. TikTok is a content-first shopping platform.

## Highlights

- Bestsellers on TikTok are not items from established brands, and stores with the most sales volume are not big-box retailers. It is not Away luggage or Glossier makeup or a retailer like Walmart or Target. Top sellers on TikTok are items that went viral instead. And even if their virality hasnâ€™t reached the levels of _The Shadow Work Journal_, their sales are still a result of millions of video views.
