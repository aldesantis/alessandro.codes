## Summary

The author emphasizes that our emotions and intuitions often contain contradictions and can be better understood through writing. By engaging in a dialogue with oneself through systematic writing, we can clarify our beliefs and achieve a deeper sense of authenticity. This process allows us to align our thoughts and feelings, leading to a more fulfilling life.

## Highlights

- In this way, reason actually becomes a process that makes me _less_ numb to myself. By engaging myself across time, I can build layers of complexity and precision that let me go deeper than I can without the support of logic, reason, and writing. Writing is a tool for emotion as much as a tool for thought.
- easy. It is clearly common for people to think themselves numb. You have to take that risk seriously. Also, you have to accept that not everything can be captured in language and be sensitive to that leftover that floats around languageless in your body.
- Intuitions are a type of pattern matching, closely entwined with perception. They are qualified guesses. “Based on my understanding of the world, which is a compressed representation of what I have experienced [footnote: and also some things that are hardcoded into my genes because of stuff my ancestors experienced]—I think this guy is a sociopath.”
- Emotions, on the other hand, are the source of our values. We feel anger because we perceive that a political decision threatens the well-being of our children. We feel jealousy because a rival got something that we perceive that we need to flourish. Emotions are, in other words, not just waves of irrational energies that crash over us: they are a type of cognition. It is a part of cognition that assigns values to things, so we can make priorities and protect what is central to our well-being, or flourishing.
