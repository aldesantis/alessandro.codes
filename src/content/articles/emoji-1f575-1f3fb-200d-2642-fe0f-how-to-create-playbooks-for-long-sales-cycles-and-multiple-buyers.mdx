## Summary

The fundamental enterprise marketing mismatch: engaging accounts with 3-week sales cadences and marketing campaigns while the enterprise sales cycles are 12-18 months.

## Highlights

- You need a map of who’s actually involved in the deal. There are user buyers (power users feeling the pain), economic buyers (holding the budget), technical buyers (evaluating your solution), and influencers (internal champions who can create awareness).
- But don’t stop there. Map the ecosystem around your target accounts.
  The [B2B buyer ecosystem](https://substack.com/redirect/6f5ea7a6-245b-4eb7-a185-b2448e2f5e4e?j=eyJ1IjoiMzF0OWQ3In0.njlt-VgaBE6SfoWFbTMJa0tjIb5-6E_g5OVmeLJYsT4) consists of all the channels and communities where your target buyers learn about solutions, consume content, engage with peers, [follow thought leaders, and interact with partners](https://substack.com/redirect/6f5ea7a6-245b-4eb7-a185-b2448e2f5e4e?j=eyJ1IjoiMzF0OWQ3In0.njlt-VgaBE6SfoWFbTMJa0tjIb5-6E_g5OVmeLJYsT4).
- Ask yourself:
  - What thought leaders or vendors are my buyers following?
  - Are they active in specific communities or industry associations?
  - What channels or industry events do they use for professional education?
  - What activities is your team already planning that you can make account-based?
