## Summary

Arc’teryx collaborated with Indigenous designer Cole Sparrow-Crawford for their new Walk Gently line, blending native arts with technical fabrics. The collection celebrates Indigenous craftsmanship and heritage, reflecting traditional designs in modern products. Sparrow-Crawford’s partnership with Arc’teryx aims to honor Indigenous communities and ensure their heritage lives on through storytelling and design.

## Highlights

- Historically, many fashion labels have appropriated aspects of native design. But some brands are now making a concerted effort to collaborate with Indigenous designers. Ralph Lauren recently launched a long-term collaboration with [Navajo weaver and designer Naiomi Glasses](https://www.fastcompany.com/90992100/ralph-laurens-new-collection-redefines-the-american-aesthetic). Canada Goose collaborates with Inuit designers, whose ancestors invented the parka.
