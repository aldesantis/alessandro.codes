## Summary

Direct-to-consumer brands once relied on Meta to acquire customers on their own websites but are now moving to Amazon.

## Highlights
- Jack Ogilvie, partner at ad agency Acadia, said that DTC brands used to expect that every ad dollar put into Meta would drive $7 to $8 in sales, but performance is now closer to $1 or $2 in sales for every ad dollar.
- Another reason why Amazon has become more viable for DTCs is that its ad prices have recently decreased while [ad prices](https://www.businessinsider.com/digital-ad-prices-are-skyrocketing-in-2022-2) on other platforms have skyrocketed
- 75% of brands find that it's cheaper to acquire customers on Amazon than any other media channel.
