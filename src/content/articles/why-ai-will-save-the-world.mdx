## Summary

There’s a full-blown moral panic about AI right now. But the real risk is losing the race to global AI technological superiority.

## Highlights

- The Lump Of Labor Fallacy flows naturally from naive intuition, but naive intuition here is wrong. When technology is applied to production, we get [*productivity growth*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity) – an increase in output generated by a reduction in inputs. The result is _lower prices_ for goods and services. As prices for goods and services fall, we pay less for them, meaning that we now have _extra spending power_ with which to buy _other things_. This _increases demand_ in the economy, which drives the creation of _new production_ – including new products and new industries – which then creates new jobs for the people who were replaced by machines in prior jobs. The result is a larger economy with higher material prosperity, more industries, more products, and more jobs.
- But the good news doesn’t stop there. We also get higher wages. This is because, at the level of the individual worker, the marketplace sets compensation as a function of the [*marginal productivity of the worker*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_revenue_productivity_theory_of_wages). A worker in a technology-infused business will be more productive than a worker in a traditional business. The employer will either pay that worker more money as he is now more productive, or another employer will, purely out of self interest. The result is that technology introduced into an industry generally not only increases the number of jobs in the industry but also raises wages.
