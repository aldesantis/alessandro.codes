## Summary

Some direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands are seeing improved results after tough years, with companies like Warby Parker and Hims & Hers raising their sales outlooks. However, other brands, like Brilliant Earth, are struggling and lowering their expectations due to cautious consumer spending. Marketing strategies and the use of artificial intelligence are becoming key factors for success as brands navigate a challenging economic environment.

## Highlights

- Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis, said generally speaking, two types of companies are performing well right now: those that sell essential goods, or those that sell non-essentials “that have built a particularly strong relationship with a consumer and have a differentiated value proposition.”
- Lipsman said that in order to take a 360-degree marketing approach, brands have to invest in things that build true cultural awareness. And what makes true cultural awareness, he said isn’t just that a random person off the street is familiar with a brand, but that “any person knows that the person next to them also knows what that brand is.”
