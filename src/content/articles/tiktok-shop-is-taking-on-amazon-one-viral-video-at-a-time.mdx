## Summary

TikTok has surged into the e-commerce space, positioning itself as a kind of Amazon for the social media age. Analysts say it might work, but users and sellers are asking: At what price?

## Highlights

- “They don’t allow us to set our own processing times, and if you go viral on TikTok … our orders and our inventory got super backed up,” [Biggers-Stewart said in her video](https://www.tiktok.com/@thebiggersthebetter/video/7294354427568213291). “TikTok Shop is not conducive to small businesses.”
- But McCormick acknowledges that her frustration — as a Generation Z user mindful about consumption — is not particularly common. For many young people online, shopping has become not just a hobby but a distraction from the daily stress of life.
  “I know a lot of people around me use it to kind of unwind, relax at the end of the day or when they’re taking a break,” she said. “So there’s not a lot of … thinking happening during that time, mostly because you’re trying to destress and relax after a long day.”
- “When we’re watching social media, we’re really connecting with our influencers that we love and have a parasocial relationship with,” she said.
  “That reduces a lot of friction around purchasing, and it may influence our decision-making when we go and click that button.”
