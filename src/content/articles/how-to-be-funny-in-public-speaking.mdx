## Summary

Jia Jiang explains how humor enhances public speaking and helps audiences remember key lessons. He emphasizes the importance of leaning into weird thoughts and emotions to create relatable and funny content. By recognizing and sharing these moments, anyone can become funnier and connect better with their audience.

## Highlights

- If people are laughing at your jokes, it’s so much easier for them to pay attention and remember your lessons.
- We all have weird thoughts constantly going through our minds. Most of us don’t pay attention to them and even actively suppress them because we don’t want to think weird and feel weird.
  However, these weird thoughts are seeds of ingenuity and ingredients for humor because if it’s weird to you, it’s weird to everyone.
