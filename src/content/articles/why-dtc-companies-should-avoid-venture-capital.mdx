## Summary

All that cash might be tempting, but the motivations of founders and venture investors are rarely aligned, writes Imran Amed.

## Highlights

- When venture investors take control of your company, the power balance changes and they can push you to do things that might not make sense for its long-term viability. They are incentivised to push companies to grow at all costs, even if it means pushing them to the brink. Their model works even when just one in ten of their investments achieves a billion-dollar exit as that rare, outsized return makes up for all of the losses on many more failed investments.
  Meanwhile, as an entrepreneur, you only have one shot.
