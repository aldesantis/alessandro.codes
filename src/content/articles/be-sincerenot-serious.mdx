## Summary

Why white-knuckling your way through life doesn’t work

## Highlights

- A finite game, where the goal is to win, can easily become a serious, grave affair, devoid of fun and levity. An infinite game, where the goal is nothing more—or less—than continuing to play, lends itself to sincerity. Confusing an infinite game for a finite game can be a subtle source of suffering in life.
- If you can cultivate a sense of playfulness within the challenges of life, you might be surprised by what you can accomplish (in both the short and long term).
