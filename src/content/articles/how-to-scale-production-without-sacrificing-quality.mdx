## Summary

In my welcome email for this newsletter, I ask new subscribers what their biggest content marketing problem or conundrum is. And I get a ton of answers back to this, y’all!

## Highlights

- **POV:** Content should take a strong stance, and have a clear point of view. Make bold claims, and back them up with data and subject matter experts.
- **Proprietary data: Include** The proprietary data in as much of your content as you can, with well-made data visualizations to reinforce that your company, and only your company, have the necessary data to own the conversation.
- **Premium access:** Include at least 2-3 partners, customers, experts or influencers in your content to increase the premium feel, giving readers access to insights from folks few other brands can interview.
- It starts with your brief. Briefs should include:
  - Why this topic, why right now?
  - What’s our POV / hypothesis?
  - Audience for the topic
  - Competing content for the topic
  - Existing resources on the topic
  - Supporting research / evidence to reference:
  - Folks to interview
- Then, once a draft comes back, send it through a **“strategy edit.”** This is not a line edit. Instead, you are editing the:
  1. Strength of the argument
  2. Strength of the headline
  3. Strength of the intro
  4. Strength of the interviews
  5. Strength of the brands used as examples
  6. Strength of the data and the correlations being made
  7. Strength of the overall storyline
  From there, either send the piece to copy edit, or back to the writer to clean it up before the final copy edit.
