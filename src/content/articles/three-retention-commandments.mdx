## Summary

The text discusses three key pillars for customer retention: knowing the customer, testing strategies, and managing email frequency. It emphasizes the importance of understanding customer behavior, conducting proper testing, and avoiding excessive email bombardment to maintain long-term customer relationships. The author shares insights on retention strategies and cautions against prioritizing short-term gains over sustainable customer engagement.

## Highlights

- I have often seen folks build a community and then use that as a place to ask customers questions.
  While that is great, considering you are talking to your already top 1% of customers (hell, they joined a Facebook group of your BRAND), it won’t help you much to unlock info from the one-and-done customers or the not-super-engaged customers.

- The easiest way to keep your customers engaged with your brand is to better understand which direction the wind is already blowing.
  It is easier to encourage already existing behavior than to try to create net new ones.
- This is the email marketer’s paradox. Once you crank up the frequency, it’s almost impossible to scale back without top-level intervention—and often, it’s those at the top who were cheering for the increase in the first place.
