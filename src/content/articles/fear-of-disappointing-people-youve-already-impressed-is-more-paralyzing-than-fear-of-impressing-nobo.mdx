## Summary

Fear of disappointing people you’ve already impressed is more paralyzing than fear of impressing nobody. Success creates pressure to repeat, which can block creativity and cause anxiety. The best way forward is to focus on truth and personal growth, not just pleasing others.

## Highlights

- Encore anxiety haunts every creative field. Success creates pressure to repeat, and that pressure quickly paralyzes.
- We’re not far off from having AI versions of our audience embedded in our workflow. **The damage is the loss of internal creative solitude.**
