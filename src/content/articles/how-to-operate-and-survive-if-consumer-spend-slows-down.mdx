## Summary

Hey there. First thing is first, I am incredibly saddened by the events in Israel this weekend.

## Highlights

- If you’re fortunate enough to be bootstrapped and don’t have investors to answer you, you are lucky. There is likely going to be a consumer pulback, which means growth is going to be hard. Don’t force it. You don’t have to grow. Forget the medals, or pros given on Twitter if you post revenue screenshots. It means nothing; but it’s good for the ego. The only thing that matters in this market is survival, and that is done with profitability and cash flow positivity.
