## Summary

The text discusses how culture is becoming tokenized in the crypto world, with a focus on Culture Tokens. It emphasizes the importance of aligning incentives, democratizing access, and building products that accelerate culture on-chain. The author encourages crypto builders to consider the opportunities in developing the culture layer for the future of crypto.

## Highlights
- Tokenizing culture works because people understand culture. Whether you like it or not, the average person doesnâ€™t care about ZK Proofs, Optimistic Rollups, or Parallelized EVM. All of these things are amazing, but they are not driving headlines that are getting more people to participate.
