## Summary

Before we get into it, I want to thank this week’s sponsor: Goodo Studios. Goodo Studios produces content that helps your brand grab the attention of the right viewers and turn them into customers.

## Highlights

- The fashion consumer might be shopping for a specific occasion, or they might feel they have “nothing to wear”. A single garment can solve thousands of similar “problems”; speaking to all of them isn’t scalable.
- Most DTC marketing advice tells brands to validate their product with Consideration phase consumers (usually via Meta). When the brand has tapped out the audience pool in Consideration, they move up the funnel to Solution Aware, then Problem Aware.
- To vet a problem/solution product you need to use it to see if it works. For that reason, people are more likely to buy one product at a time, especially given online return windows.
  ​
  Fashion is different. Shoppers take the “dressing room” approach home. They might order options from several brands, or several options from a single brand, and return all but one.
  ​
  Winning the conversion doesn’t require you to beat out the competition. But winning the revenue (i.e. avoiding a return) requires the brand to be transparent about what they’re selling and provide as much relevant info as possible.
