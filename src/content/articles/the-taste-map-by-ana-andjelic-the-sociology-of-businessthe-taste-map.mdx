The taste map

## Summary

How consumers’ taste shapes brand strategy

## Highlights

- Taste shapes how we see the world. It encodes symbols and meaning into products, places and people. Taste connects the symbolic and the commercial, and links aesthetics to consumer behavior. It reveals consumers values, identity and their desired status.

- Taste is still used to create social distance: between the creative class and others, between modern aspirants and the Big Luxury consumer, between plugged-ins and basics. It is a powerful mechanism of signaling identity and belonging, and it is increasingly niche.
- The top two quadrants (Q1 and Q4) are about status signaling through showing off one’s cultural savvy and plugged in-ness. This is the territory of the modern aspirational economy, and has less to do with money and more with having knowledge, aesthetic sensibility and the right creative network.
