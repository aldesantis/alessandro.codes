## Summary

In 2024, direct-to-consumer startups struggled to prove their value to customers amid high inflation and cautious spending. Many brands had to adapt their strategies and connect more with consumers, as buying decisions took longer than in previous years. Despite some companies seeing success, overall sales growth was flat for many startups, leading to a focus on building lasting customer relationships.

## Highlights
- Aaron Luo, co-founder and CEO of bag brand Caraa, has a theory that consumers are taking longer to buy because they have access to more information than ever before. He divides the trajectory of modern consumer startups into two eras: pre-Covid — when customers clamored over startups like Away and Casper because they released a pretty-looking, digitally native version of a consumer staple — and post-Covid, when shoppers were spending a lot more time online, had more time to research and, perhaps, had been previously burned by a hot DTC startup.
