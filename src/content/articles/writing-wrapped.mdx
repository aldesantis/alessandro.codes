## Summary

Working Theorys is a collection of essays on life, art, & business, thru the lens of startups — written by me, for thousands of readers.

## Highlights

- Every startup needs a “cringe hire” — someone who will be as hyper cringe in public as needed to help the company win.
- Some of you think the solution to everything is to walk more and I’m sorry I ever doubted you.
- One remarkable thing to observe is that people who become truly great, in almost any field or discipline, tend also to become great philosophers along the way.
- Every single good idea starts with a good conversation. Optimize your life for good conversations.
