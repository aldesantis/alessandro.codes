## Summary

During my time at LuMee back in ‘15 – ‘18, we scaled DTC-first, expanded into Amazon, then Retail. eCom was our biggest channel, with ~50% of this biz on DTC + Amazon.

## Highlights
- But when you take a step back and look at the macro, the average eCom/Retail biz has 10-15% net operating income. It’s one of those natural laws of the universe.
- Shopify says they're “arming the rebels,” but the featured Product Updates say “Ent. Ent. Ent. Read all about it!”
