## Summary

Correlation does not mean causation, as many people mistakenly believe that a correlation between two variables implies a direct cause-and-effect relationship. This confusion often leads to overconfidence in using correlations to support claims, despite evidence showing that they can be misleading. In reality, correlations can arise from various indirect paths and shared causes, making them unreliable for guiding important decisions.

## Highlights

- Besides the intuitiveness of correlation=causation, we are also desperate and _want to believe_: correlative data is so rich and so plentiful, and experimental data so rare.
- there are those that completely accept the inability to make a causal inference on the basis of simple correlation or association and, instead, take refuge in the claim that they are studying only associations and not causation. This second, “pure” approach sounds safer, but it is disingenuous because it is difficult to see why anyone would be interested in statistical associations or correlations if the findings were not in some way relevant to an understanding of causative mechanisms.
- turns out, we weren’t supposed to be reasoning ‘there are 3 categories of possible relationships, so we start with 33%’, but rather: ‘there is only one explanation “A causes B”, only one explanation “B causes A”, but there are many explanations of the form “C1 causes A and B”, “C2 causes A and B”, “C3 causes A and B”…’, and the more nodes in a field’s true causal networks (psychology or biology vs physics, say), the bigger this last category will be.
