## Summary

The author built an AI tool that uses Socratic mirroring and a step-by-step reasoning scaffold to help people craft stronger arguments. Testing across universities, companies, startups, and government showed the tool speeds real, high-stakes work and generalises across domains. The approach ties solid theory to practical design and aims for institutional adoption.

## Highlights

- designing AI tools as mirrors of user meaning not generators of meaning
