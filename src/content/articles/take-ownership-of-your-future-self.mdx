## Summary

Dr. Daniel Gilbert highlights the “end of history illusion,” where individuals believe their current selves are the finished product and struggle to see potential for change in the future. Change is inevitable, and strategies are provided to help individuals become their desired future selves. By distinguishing between former, current, and future selves, imagining a desired future, and changing the identity narrative, individuals can actively shape who they become, focusing on intentional growth and transformation into their envisioned future self.

## Highlights

- Most people, when asked if they are the same person they were 10 years ago, will say no — but we have a much harder time seeing potential for change in the future.
- Human beings are works in progress that mistakenly think they’re finished.
- The truth is, you’re not the same person you were in the past. You don’t do things the same way you once did. You no longer want what you once wanted. Instead of labeling yourself and focusing on who you are today, recognize how much you’ve grown and changed from your former self.
- Just ask yourself: What wins have I had in the past 90 days? Once you start to distinguish between your current and former selves, it becomes possible to view your future self as a different person as well.
- It’s much easier to default to the present than to imagine a different future. But if you don’t take the time to imagine who you want to be, then you’ll reactively become whatever life drives you towards.
