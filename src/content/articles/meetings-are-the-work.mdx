## Summary

Wherein I take aim at the common tech trope that people need to limit meetings to get work done.

## Highlights

- although individual learning (already hard enough) is necessary for organizational learning, organizational learning is not a simple by-product of individual learning. It’s significantly more complex for _groups_ of people develop whole new theories-in-use and behaviors to better carry out the organization’s purpose.

- Amazon called on on workers to act when they have about 70% of the information they wish they had, an explicit call to loosen the definition of “true enough” in the interest of speed.

- Our industry suffers from a deep association of work with structured productive toil, a framing that’s in every way a bad fit for knowledge work. Knowledge work is uncertain and messy (and sometimes enjoyable too). The messiness _can_ be avoided, but only at the cost of sacrificing the power and dignity of the work itself.

- Knowledge-making is unruly. You can’t know up-front which things are tangents. Even one distracted participant can sour a batch. Forming new knowledge requires you to be open to whole people, not just the facet of their expected role.
