## Summary

Americans, including high-income earners, are cutting back on spending and opting for discount shopping. Consumer sentiment is cautious amid concerns about the economy’s direction. Companies like Costco are maintaining low prices to attract and retain customers.

## Highlights

- On Thursday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said that his customers are slowing down the rate of their purchases. Consumer payments, as measured through credit cards, checks and ATM withdrawals, have grown by 3.5% since last year, he said. That’s down from 10% growth the year before.

- A [recent survey](https://kpmg.com/us/en/media/news/2024-american-perspectives-survey.html) by accounting firm KPMG found a similar pattern. While people are still mostly optimistic about their own financial situations, they worry about the direction of the US economy, they found. Additionally, 65% of those surveyed, including nearly 60% of those making $200,000 or more, said that they expect to do more discount shopping this year, while 14% plan to use buy now, pay later services.
