## Summary

Mytheresa, a Munich-based e-tailer, stands out in the challenging online luxury sector, reporting 8.3 percent growth in sales during its second quarter. Their success is attributed to targeting high-spending customers with unique experiences like private New York City Ballet rehearsals. While competitors like Net-a-Porter and Farfetch struggle, Mytheresa remains optimistic, focusing on luxury, exclusivity, and brand activations to maintain growth, with plans to expand events and partnerships to enhance their position in the market.

## Highlights
- That growth was driven by the company’s focus on courting [high-spending customers](https://www.businessoffashion.com/case-studies/luxury/top-one-percent-wealthy-customers-gucci-mytheresa-tiffany/) with enviable experiences, such as bringing clients to a private rehearsal of the New York City Ballet. The number of US shoppers in that cohort jumped 48 percent in the company’s second quarter.
