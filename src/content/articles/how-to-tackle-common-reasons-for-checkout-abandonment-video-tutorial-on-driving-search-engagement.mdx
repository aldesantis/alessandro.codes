## Summary

Last edition I covered tips on structuring a shopping cart abandonment email/SMS program.

## Highlights

- • Offer a [price match promise](https://ao.com/help-and-advice/finance-and-savings/price-match-promise/) if you sell branded goods that can be bought from other retailers; [AO.com](http://AO.com) does this well, asking customers to call them and they even offer to refund the differences if the price drops for a product already ordered
  - Emphasise genuine USPs and the benefits of shopping directly with you e.g. as the brand owner, it could be an extended warranty, or access to exclusive content and events
  - If you have a genuine sustainability commitment that means you won’t always be the lowest price, explain the benefits of buying with you. Able and Cole have honed their marketing message to promote the shopper and environmental benefits of ‘the Inconvenience Store’ ([see the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLmuLb8YMtc&t=2s)).
