## Summary

The text explores the concept of Lore in online communities, focusing on how shared memories and narratives develop within network media. It delves into the dynamics of livestreaming, community formation, and lore generation on platforms like TikTok. The evolving nature of online socialization and the impact of platform affordances on community building and lore dynamics are discussed.

## Highlights
- The way we remember the events that happen on the internet is different than reading a book. Information circulates and gets stored in a way that incorporates personal narratives as documentation, combining textuality with elements of oral storytelling.
- In this way, every livestream with even the most basic participatory user interface, like on Twitch or TikTok, forms an ad-hoc community of synchronized viewers that develop their own micro-body of knowledge and traditions, their own lexicon. In other words, every livestream has the potential to generate *lore*.
- Lore is intertextual, always referencing and bumping up against the lore of related domains. A body of lore and the community that is associated with it don't always match up one to one, as both are nebulous and ever-evolving. The act of circulating lore is also the act of re-authoring it.
    - Note: This is similar to the concept of bidirectionality in cultural brands.
- [The shifty and shifting nature](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/02/18/being-your-selves-identity-r-and-d-on-the-pseudonymous-internet/) of many people’s online identity practices, especially younger people who grew up on the internet, suggests that maybe they’re not as interested in developing something like a ‘personal brand’ as marketers have enjoyed [predicting](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190522005069/en/Gartner-Says-Marketers-Must-Focus-on-Boosting-Gen-Z%E2%80%99s-Personal-Brand-to-Make-Them-Loyal-Customers). Instead of latching onto one fixed identity across many digital spaces, they embody various roles and play with different and novel modes of interpersonal relationship-building online, and find value in aligning themselves with small, close-knit internet communities.
