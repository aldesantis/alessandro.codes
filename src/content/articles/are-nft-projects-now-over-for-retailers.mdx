## Summary

Technical difficulties, fraud and low consumer interest cloud the market for non-fungible tokens.

## Highlights
- In an [October 2022 Forrester report](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2023-metaverse-nfts/), the Cambridge-based research and advisory firm predicted that NFT projects released from this year on will no longer be considered innovative.
- “Essentially, an NFT is just a glorified receipt,” Bennett said. “What makes an NFT different from any other receipt is that it’s programmable… [for] exclusive access can be to something digital, to something online, to an event or to some preview catalog or whatever it may be, but it can also be a physical access ticket to somewhere. And so it’s that utility that you can have as part of that that makes it attractive.”

- As brands began partnering with tech firms to release NFTs beyond public blockchains, the consumers who saw the NFTs for loyalty perks continued to engage with the brand, but NFT enthusiasts who wanted to trade those tokens for profit weren’t enthused about these assets not being available publicly to being sequestered, she added.
