## Summary

Social media turned praise into performance. We now have to publicly signal support, which takes time and energy. That pressure drains attention from making real work and from quieter, meaningful gestures.

## Highlights

- Private praise isn’t enough anymore—it has to be followed by performative praise. There’s an expectation to perform praise, loyalty, affiliation, intimacy in public. Wherever my people are online, it’s my duty to witness and champion them. Friendship as performance art. Social media as social theater.
- Perhaps the greatest cost: the more time you spend waiting in the wings to boost others, the less time you have to build something worth boosting. You’re trapped in an economy where you must give attention to receive it, but giving attention drains the focus you need to actually create things that deserve it. How valuable is your attention to yourself versus to others, and what silent exchange rate are you paying?
