## Summary

The text discusses 30 useful concepts for understanding the world, ranging from dopamine culture to champion bias. These concepts aim to provide insights into various aspects of human behavior and decision-making. The author encourages readers to explore these ideas further for personal growth and understanding.

## Highlights

- The delay between desire & gratification is shrinking. Pleasure is increasingly more instant & effortless. Everything is becoming a drug. What will it do to us?
- Our model of the world assumes people are like us. We don’t just do whatever we consider normal, we also consider normal whatever we do.
- The more similar two choices seem, the less the decision should matter, yet the harder it is to choose between them. As a result, we often spend the most time on the decisions that matter least.
- Being pro-choice and being pro-gun-control don’t necessarily follow from each other, yet those who believe one usually also believe the other. This is because most people don’t choose beliefs individually but subscribe to “packages” of beliefs offered by a tribe.

- _**Imagine you wake up in a hospital.** What could have been the most likely reason? Is there anything you can do today to prevent that?_
  _**Imagine your partner breaks up with you.** What could have been the most likely reason? Is there anything you can do today to prevent that?_
  _**Imagine you lose your job.** What could have been the most likely reason? Is there anything you can do today to prevent that?_
- When a source makes an unproven claim, is then cited as proof by another, which is cited by another, and so on, until the chain of citations looks like evidence. Common because, while many writers check their sources, few check their sources’ sources.
  A recent example: evidence that puberty blockers are safe and effective was overestimated because institutions were [circularly citing each other](https://www.buttonslives.news/p/new-systematic-review-exposes-deceptive):
- The more you pursue happiness, the less likely you are to obtain it, because the focus on acquiring it only reinforces the fact that you don’t have it. Ironically, happiness comes easiest to those who don’t worry about it.
- Many long-term studies, including the 50 year [Roseto study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1695733/) and the 85 year [Harvard Study of Adult Development](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/), found that having close-knit relationships is as important for longevity as diet, sleep, and exercise, yet it’s often neglected by fitness gurus. If you want to live, love.

  If you make a claim, it’s up to you to prove it, not to me to disprove it.

- Multiple studies have found that people consistently underestimate how much a conversation partner likes them and enjoys their company. So don’t be shy, you’re probably cooler than you think.

- Groups are meant to be better decision-makers than individuals, because they combine many perspectives. But in practice, a group doesn’t base its decisions on the info specific to each member, but only on the info common to them all. This casts doubt on the idea that “two heads are better than one”, and helps explain why, despite popular wisdom, diversity generally [does not make teams better](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/nscd4).
- Both sides in a court case or policy debate will have support from experts, no matter how crazy the position, because education doesn’t make someone right, it often just makes them more skilled at being wrong.
- Most of your beliefs were formed earlier in your life, when you were naiver. You continue to believe them only because you’ve never reconsidered them. When you’re about to offer an opinion, consider when you formed it, and ask: is it really _your_ belief, or your younger self’s?
- One day you’ll do something for the last time and never know it. So, whether you’re watching a sunset or arguing with a friend, ask yourself: “What if this was the last time I experience this?” A sense of finality can turn even nuisances into miracles.
