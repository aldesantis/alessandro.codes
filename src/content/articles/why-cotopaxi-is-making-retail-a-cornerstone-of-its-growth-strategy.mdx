## Summary

Cotopaxi is growing from a niche outdoors B-corp into a nine-figure brand as it expands its retail footprint across the country.

## Highlights

- While consumers are increasingly shopping online, roughly 85% of retail spending still happens in person, [per Census Bureau data](https://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/www/data/pdf/ec_current.pdf).

- While in the past brands might have concentrated efforts on major metros like New York or San Francisco, DTC brands are cropping up [in neighborhoods like Georgetown](https://www.modernretail.co/marketing/a-crowd-draws-a-crowd-why-dtc-brands-are-seeking-a-spot-d-c-s-georgetown-neighborhood-in-d-c/) in Washington, D.C., or commercial stretches like [South Congress Avenue in Austin](https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/dtc-briefing-the-most-sought-after-retail-neighborhoods-for-startups/). The trend not only aims to maximize tourist foot traffic but help a brand gain national recognition between the coasts.
