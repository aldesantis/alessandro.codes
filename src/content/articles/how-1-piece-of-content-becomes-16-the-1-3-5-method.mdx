## Summary

The 1-3-5 method is simple. You create one substantial piece of content, and then break it up into a bunch of bite-size pieces.

## Highlights
- Now, for **each** of your three core ideas, you’ll create five pieces of micro-content:
  • **Two short, written posts:** Pull impactful sentences from your content.
  • **One short-form video:** Summarize your key point in 60 seconds or less.
  • **One carousel post:** Break down your concept in 5-10 slides.
  • **One poll or question post:** Make a statement, and then ask a question to engage your audience and gather information.
