## Summary

The author, Rosie Spinks, explores the concept of being “collapse aware,” recognizing that societal progress is not guaranteed and that we may face significant changes in our way of life. This awareness allows her to embrace a dual perspective, balancing hope for incremental improvements while preparing for a future that may involve challenges. Ultimately, she finds that acknowledging the realities of collapse can inspire meaningful action and connection in her life.

## Highlights

- The environment — the literal earth we stand on — has a diametrically opposed set of values to our political system. One is exponential, and the other is cyclical.
- Most of the things we need to do to heal the planet and our society are the same things that would heal ourselves.
- So start thinking today about how you can attain some of those things elsewhere, from non-monetary or transactional means. Start small. Do you get all your pleasure and leisure from consumption, traveling, and other carbon or resource-intensive activities? Maybe you join a choir and make music with your neighbors, paint your surroundings, or work in a garden instead.
