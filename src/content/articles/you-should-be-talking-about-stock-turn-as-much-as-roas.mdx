## Summary

Stock turn is a key metric that measures how often inventory is sold and replenished, yet it is often overlooked in retail discussions. Ignoring stock turn can lead to overbuying, cash flow issues, and poor customer experiences. To improve business efficiency and profitability, it should be prioritized alongside marketing metrics like ROAS in all trade meetings.

## Highlights

- Poor stock turn ties up capital, slows cashflow, increases warehousing costs, and leads to markdowns. And when you do finally sell it? Your margin’s gone. Worse still, your customers probably had a crap experience along the way.
