## Summary

What not to do when building a B2B startup

## Highlights

- Simply put, an ICP must be _a single_ _market segment_: a group of people for whom the value of solving a problem is roughly the same, and who can be reached in roughly the same way.

- ICP fray confuses _every_ decision for a very simple reason: to know what problem you’re solving, you need to know who you’re solving it for. On the journey to product-market fit, we know products often change quickly. But the chances of finding fit go down dramatically if the market is changing as well.

- Encountering demand outside of your ICP may seem like a good thing, but be _very_ careful about supporting those customers and expanding to a new segment. Yes, you may discover a whole new market for your product, but along the way, recognize that you’re allowing your customer focus to fray. Either validate the new market segment and pivot into it, or stick to your guns and move on.

- We needed to remember that our customers do not care about our TAM. All they care about is their specific set of problems. Building a horizontal tool is especially hard, because each supported use case often competes with a tailor-made, vertical solution.

- Horizontal products win if a specific audience encounters enough use cases that they want one tool to address them all. Figma won because it captured a much larger portion of an app designer’s workflow than Sketch or Illustrator did. Notion won because it addressed the vast array of documentation tasks faced by product managers in San Francisco. In both cases, a specific buyer encountered a large array of problems, so a horizontal toolkit was the best solution.
