## Summary

Companies like Peace Out Skincare are turning to out-of-home options like billboards and banners to diversify away from TikTok.

## Highlights
- I really do feel it’s become more of a well-rounded [approach], where old ways of advertising are now becoming new: catalogs and posties, inserts, things that we traditionally used before we had digital media. So we’re starting to play more to that, which is very exciting. And we’re actually starting to see the consumer come to us, which has been great.
