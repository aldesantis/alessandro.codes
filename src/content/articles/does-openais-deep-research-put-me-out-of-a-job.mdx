## Summary

Sam Altman from OpenAI suggests that their new AI product, deep research, could replace about 8.2 million jobs in the U.S. by automating knowledge work. While deep research can be useful for answering questions, it currently lacks the expertise of a skilled professional. The rapid advancement of AI raises concerns about job security and wage pressure for workers in research-related fields.

## Highlights

- Technology may decrease costs and increase economic output. But whether the labor captures any of that benefit—or even if they escape the economic destruction of their profession—is dependent on a range of political and socio-economic factors that go beyond the technology itself.
- The reality of a technology that can perform “economically valuable tasks” occurs when either:
  1. There is a new task to perform (like how computers helped us code).
  2. It automates an existing type of labor (dishwashers made it so we didn’t have to wash dishes).
  3. It makes an existing form of labor more productive (hammers helped us construct homes faster).
- In five years, I imagine the majority of the system’s subtle errors will disappear. Anyone looking for a job as an entry-level analyst will have a significantly harder time finding employment, or at least a living wage. Many aspects of how the internet works today—where publishers are incentivized to post information for free because users will find it and view ads at the same time—could be in jeopardy as well.
