## Summary

The digitalization of B2B has traditionally been slower than that of B2C. Today, many merchants manage B2B orders manually, using spreadsheets or even pen and paper. However, B2B ecommerce has grown in popularity in recent years.

## Highlights
- In some B2B models, sales agents act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers. A sales agent can place orders for one or more assigned customers. Every time an agent makes a sale, the system calculates a commission.
