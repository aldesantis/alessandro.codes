## Summary

A memo is just me writing out my thinking.

## Highlights
- 99% of what we do, including the decisions we make, just doesn’t matter. You won’t remember it in a month and neither will the rest of the world.
  We humans have this weird sense of self-importance. Like every decision we make will send ripples through the space time continuum. Maybe…but are you going to be around to do a pulse check?
