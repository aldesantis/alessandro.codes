## Summary

Unchecked, dead stock can be the silent killer of an otherwise successful business because it hammers profitability and ties up working capital.

## Highlights
- Unchecked, dead stock can be the silent killer of an otherwise successful business because it hammers profitability and ties up working capital.
- Committing cash to inventory that doesn’t sell means the same money can’t be used elsewhere. Working capital is critical in all business cases especially if a brand operates with thin margins or are aggressively scaling year on year.
- Control catalogue width. Often the quickest way to increase growth in a business is to increase the width of the offering - meaning expansion of ranges, launching of new categories (e.g. fashion brand launching athleisure or sleepwear, for instance) - but this makes the management of stock increasingly complex and difficult.

- Identify dead stock early and have a plan of attack of how to deal with it. Combine data with human input here - let the data tell you *how* dead something is, let a person decide how to deal with it.
