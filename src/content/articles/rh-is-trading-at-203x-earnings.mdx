## Summary

Everything about RH’s P&L is wrong, and they’re betting the farm despite the market not being in their favor… So, we’re shorting this biz.

## Highlights

- Interest rate cuts _just_ started in September to move down from historic highs. The housing market won’t _actually_ start moving again until a reduction of 1-2% total off of 40 year historic highs. Will that happen before 2026? (We’re currently at 0.5%. Probably not.)
- At a certain point, everyone who has a seat at the table has so much of their comp tied up in the stock price that it’s more valuable for them to boost the stock price then run the biz properly.
- The average LVMH House (along with most staple consumer brands) is **50–75+ years old.** Everyone needs to stop deluding themselves that they’ll build a multi-billion dollar brand in under a decade.
