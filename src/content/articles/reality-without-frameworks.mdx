## Summary

Frameworks help us organize messy reality, but they can also limit our thinking and understanding. Relying too much on frameworks can make us overlook important details and unique situations. To truly grasp reality, it’s beneficial to observe and analyze information without the influence of frameworks first.

## Highlights

- Reality is messy and disorganised. Frameworks are anything but. Frameworks promise to bring order to reality in pleasing ways. They blunt the chaos and give you buckets with which to categorise your observations. Frameworks are so compelling to the human mind because the mind is a sense-making tool, and sense-making tools abhor _not_ making sense of information.
