## Summary

Or a glimpse into post-entertainment society (it’s not pretty)

## Highlights

- The fastest growing sector of the culture economy is _distraction_. Or call it scrolling or swiping or wasting time or whatever you want. But it’s not art or entertainment, just ceaseless activity.
- TikTok made a fortune with fast-paced scrolling video. And now Facebook—once a place to connect with family and friends—is imitating it. _So long, Granny, hello Reels_. Twitter has done the same. And, of course, Instagram, YouTube, and everybody else trying to get rich on social media.
  This is more than just the hot trend of 2024. It can last forever—because it’s based on body chemistry, not fashion or aesthetics.
