## Highlights

- Alexander Technique is an embodied, real-world mindfulness practice that doesn’t involve sitting on a cushion. It can help you notice, expand and play within that space between stimulus and response.
- Alexander Technique gives you conscious control over your awareness and from there more agency in any aspect of your life, whether it’s how you move, how you think, how you perform, how you speak, how you relate to others or how you relate to yourself.
