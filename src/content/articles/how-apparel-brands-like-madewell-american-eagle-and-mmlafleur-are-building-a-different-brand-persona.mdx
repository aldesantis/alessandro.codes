## Summary

Apparel brands like Madewell, American Eagle, and M.M.LaFleur are using Substack to connect with audiences through storytelling and valuable content. They share styling tips, personal essays, and insights while building a unique brand personality that differs from their social media presence. This approach has led to increased engagement and sales, making Substack a successful platform for fashion marketing.

## Highlights

- TikTok is a certain version of us, Instagram is a certain version of us, and Snap expresses a different part of our brand personality. Now, Substack is another opportunity for us to express ourselves and how we fit into the culture.
