## Summary

Retailers are struggling with declining customer loyalty as consumers become more empowered and expect seamless shopping experiences across online and in-store channels. Many retailers are now experimenting with strategies to enhance customer experiences, such as integrating digital tools into physical stores. Best Buy, for example, is personalizing shopping experiences by creating engaging spaces and improving its app to better meet customer needs.

## Highlights

- According to Emarsys, an omnichannel customer engagement platform, 79% of US consumers in 2022 said they were loyal to specific brands, retailers, and stores. But that number dropped 14% and 13% in 2023 and 2024, respectively.
  What’s behind the drop-off? Sara Richter, chief marketing officer of Emarsys, told Retail Brew that the culprit is an “ever more empowered consumer” who is shopping across multiple channels and is “expecting the experience to flow across those channels.”
- According to the latest version of Emarsys’s loyalty index, 53% of customers reported switching from a brand because of a bad shopping experience.
