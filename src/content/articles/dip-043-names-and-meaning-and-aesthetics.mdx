## Summary

Plus, regenerative pasta, bodycare goes niche, and a Marie Antoinette-core crate cover

## Highlights
- It’s a variation of the Spotify genre effect. Gauze pop, freak folk, nerdcore… At a certain point, the specificity of labels fractures aesthetics until they’re rendered meaningless. Mireille Silcoff’s recent [essay about the collapse of true subcultures](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/21/magazine/aesthetics-tiktok-teens.html?unlocked_article_code=1.aU0.V5Yg.mLTOCaGlf3wN&smid=url-share) explores this well.
- Being in community means being around people who are not like you and who you may not like (and who you can’t block or mute!), but whose wellbeing you care about in part because it is directly connected to yours.
  Our institutions move slowly and often don’t meet our needs, so we’ve begun to look to brands and branding for a solution.
  We, as consumers, are acted upon and we call it connection.
  Who benefits from this? Who is taken advantage of? Who sets the rules?
