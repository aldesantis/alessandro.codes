## Summary

The PolyOpportunity is a global initiative focused on creating a new narrative for our complex times. It encourages us to embrace uncertainty and the full range of our humanity, moving away from traditional concepts of knowledge. The goal is to shape a future that is beautiful and meaningful, rather than striving for unattainable perfection.

## Highlights

- A careless word, an impulsive gesture, a mishap, misstep, misunderstanding, a chance encounter, a sudden gaze, a casual line in a conversation that the other person never forgets, a near-fatal accident, a smell, a sight, a touch that can change your life forever. We are always inches away from devastation or delight. Moments strike out of nowhere, they are gone before you grasp them, but then they linger and refuse to ever go away. Moments have staying power.
- He suggested we **keep friends with whom we can make inappropriate jokes**: “If you are afraid of trying out bad things with your friends because they might report you or your students or your professors, you can’t actually experiment with who you are and you become a flattened version of a human being.”
- As the historian and fascism researcher **Timothy Snyder** [points out](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/timothy-snyder-us-historiker-interview-usa-trump-li.3241842), Trump may well be what Francis Fukuyama has called **“the last man”**—an all-too-human incarnation of our worst human tendencies before these are superseded by technology or some other transhuman force that will sweep them away.
- I think depth is related to having a hidden life. And we are increasingly living without a hidden life.”
- “Slowing growth is not going to change the equation. What we need is going back to living systems. We need to have this imbalance of financial capital composted, and recycled into natural and social capital on a scale that no one’s willing to talk about. Trillions and trillions of dollars of financial capital in surplus to be recycled into natural capital. Now, I don’t know how to cause that to happen, but that is the pathway if we were to follow how living systems work.”
- **“What the f*** is business?**,” he asked and gave the answer himself: “a necessary compromise of our social values, **a last resort for a society that’s lost the ability to take care of each other**.” He suggested that “if you give technology to a bunch of hippies, you get something wonderful, but give technology to a bunch of capitalists, and you get digital feudalism.” Like technology, business is what he calls a “**nonspecific amplifier**.”
- “Underneath any reality, there is an ocean of tears. But we are so afraid to touch it.”
