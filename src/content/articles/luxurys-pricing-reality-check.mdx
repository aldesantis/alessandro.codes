## Summary

Luxury brands are recognizing that high prices have hurt demand and are adjusting their strategies to offer more affordable options. Companies like Mulberry and Michael Kors are lowering prices to attract customers, while Burberry is shifting its focus back to more accessible luxury. Industry analysts agree that the rapid price increases following the pandemic have alienated many consumers, prompting calls for better value in luxury goods.

## Highlights
- Burberry, Michael Kors and Mulberry’s comments come as no surprise, as the notion that prices are simply too high takes hold across fashion. Industry insiders increasingly agree that the sector’s slowdown is, in part, linked to a price-valuation equation that’s out of sync with reality.
- But even rich people don’t want to be taken for a ride. And data supports the notion that brands have pushed prices too far, too fast. Over the past 50 years, brands have historically raised prices by 5 to 7 percent annually, already more than twice the rate of inflation. Since the pandemic, most brands raised prices even faster, by a double-digit percentage annually, a Nov. 21 report by Bernstein found.
