## Summary

As AI makes surface creativity easy, what stays valuable is the specific, lived detail only you can bring. Personal experience — “thisness” — gives work depth and prevents it from becoming a cliché. AI can help reveal those personal roots, but it cannot replace them.

## Highlights

- His insight is that creativity is fluid—and [aligned with difficulty](https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate). When technology changes what’s difficult, what’s creative changes too.
- The French essayist and poet **Paul Valéry** once described the future as something we enter as if rowing a boat, only able to see what’s in our past.
- it’s better when it’s personal, when it’s a story that only you can tell, given who you are and the life you’ve lived. In the work itself, this often shows up as specificity, of a particular shade of blue, an acetate eyeglass frame smudged with finger oils, a miscommunicated longing—of what critic **James Wood** in _How Fiction Works_ calls _thisness_, or “any detail that draws abstraction toward itself and seems to kill that abstraction with a puff of palpability.”
