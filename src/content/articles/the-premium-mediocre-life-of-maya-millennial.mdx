## Summary

The concept of "premium mediocre" describes a lifestyle that combines a facade of aspiration with an awareness of underlying mediocrity, often seen in modern consumption habits. It reflects a cultural response to economic challenges, where individuals strive to present an image of success despite real financial uncertainty. At its core, premium mediocrity is about faking upward mobility while navigating the realities of today's economy.

## Highlights
- Premium mediocrity is a stand-in for the *classy* kind of post-scarcity digital utopia some of us like to pretend is already here, only unevenly distributed.
- premium mediocrity is creating an aura of exclusivity without *actually* excluding anyone.
- ***First***, the consumers of premium mediocre things are generally strongly and acutely self-aware about what they are doing. In the age of Yelp reviews, memes, and Twitter trends, you have to be living under a rock to harbor strong illusions about how what you consume is perceived by your more tasteful peers.
- In other words, premium mediocrity is dressing for the lifestyle you’re *supposed* to want, in order to hold on to the lifestyle you can actually afford — for now — while trying to engineer a stroke of luck.
- Here’s the thing — and this confused me for a long time — premium mediocrity is *not* a consumption aesthetic, but a financial hack powering a deliberately crafted illusion that is being strategically crafted for a purpose.
- Premium mediocrity is in part a theater put on by Maya Millennial in part to spare the feelings of parents. Inter-generational love, not inter-generational war.
- My parents still think I’m the reliably and steadily occupied suit-and-tie McKinsey-type consultant rather than an opportunistic skirmisher on the edge of that world. They think I am a dead-trees type writer rather than a traffic gambler. They aren’t entirely sure what a blog is. They think it’s my hobby. When I tell them I made a bit of money investing, they think stocks, not blockchains. I’m not even going to *try* explaining bitcoin to them. They don’t need the aggravation.
- The wealthy do not actually want to be surrounded by a naked, devastated dystopia. They are not vampires who would enjoy the sight of environments drained of life energy. They like to think they are simply winning the most in a society that’s winning overall.
- This idea of reverse reality distortion too, took me a while to figure out. Silicon Valley acknowledges the existence of the reality distortion field cast by the conjurers of new wealth. What it does not *quite* recognize is the reality distortion field that goes the other way: the theater of yes-your-plans-are-succeeding manufactured for the benefit of the leaders, so they continue trying to make the New Economy happen. It’s quite fetch.
- You have to present yourself as an MVP — a minimum viable person. You need lorem ipsum filler in your performed life. Your entire existence is a sort of audition waiting for somebody to replace the stubs of a potential life with the affordances of an actual life. You cannot afford to have the stench of desperation about you, or visible signs of having been defeated by the hollowing-out.
- Human beings are odd assets: they acquire the value the moment somebody believes in them. In this they are totally unreal, in the sense of Philip K. Dick’s definition of reality as that which does not go away when you stop believing in it. Humans come alive the moment somebody believes in them enough to invest in them. Ghosts that materialize within premium mediocre shells, conjured up by magical spells known as “non-sucky job offers”.
