## Summary

AI agents won’t replace systems of record but will raise the bar for them. The key missing piece is decision traces—recorded exceptions, approvals, and precedents—so agents can show why decisions were made. Startups that capture these traces into searchable context graphs can become the next trillion-dollar platforms.

## Highlights

- Warehouses do have a time-based view. You can query historical snapshots, track how metrics changed, and compare state across periods. But warehouses receive data via ETL after decisions are made. By the time data lands in Snowflake, the decision context is gone.
