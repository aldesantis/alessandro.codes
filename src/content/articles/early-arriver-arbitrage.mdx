## Summary

Theory #35 | The arena rewards those who arrive early.

## Highlights

- New arenas are being built all the time. Sometimes people know they’re coming. Other times, there’s no warning. Regardless, arenas tend to reward those who arrive early.
    - Tags: [[strategy]]
- Most people who are early to an arena will reap some of the rewards of these opportunities whether they realize it or not. Those who are more cognizant can actively seek them out and capitalize on them in massive ways. Even more fascinating is that the arena doesn’t have to succeed long-term in order for you to reap benefits _now_ (and potential enduring ones too).
- **it’s easy to think you’re already late to an arena even when it’s still so early.** A crowd can look big until you see how big it can _become_; only then do you realize it was actually tiny before.
