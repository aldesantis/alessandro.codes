## Summary

The author reflects on the past decade as an extension of one conversation. They discuss a lunch meeting with Graham Duncan and Josh Waitzkin, who helped them see the importance of deepening their work through writing and developing a “Soft Zone” of concentration. The author also discusses the need to find meaningful work wherever they are and the importance of building trust with partners.

## Highlights

- I’d gone back to consulting because I loved doing my work in conversation: both the real-time exchange of ideas and the way that writing down my thoughts for clients created the opportunity for a slower, more extended form of dialogue. Those were practices to deepen every day
- Business people often spend almost all their time in “competition” and almost none in practice.
- The game I’m playing can only be played in conversation with reality, and in conversation with what matters most in the realities of others.
- I love discovering the topics and areas to which each person I meet brings unusually high credibility, and constructing systems that have as many people as possible doing what they love to do. When it works, those systems are less fragile, anti-fragile even, because of the way everyone is operating in their zone of genius—that area beyond their zone of competence and even their zone of excellence, the thing they most love to do.

- Every encounter with someone – in life or on the page – who is playing an infinite game feels both like a meeting of the minds and an occasion for me to become an apprentice.
