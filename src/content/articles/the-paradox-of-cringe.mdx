## Summary

I’m hiring! – My team is growing and I’m looking for more talented people to help out.

## Highlights

- If you cringe at your former self, that’s good—it means you’ve grown. Never stop cringing.
- It’s impossible to be a life-changing presence to some without also being a complete joke to others.
