## Summary

Before we get into it, I want to thank this week’s sponsor: Layers. Layers is the first AI search & merchandising tool built exclusively for Shopify Plus.

## Highlights

- **Avoid running clearance on your own eCom channel.** If you have to move inventory, sell it to a 3rd party discounter (like Nordstrom Rack) or create a separate “outlet” site with its own pixels and email list.
