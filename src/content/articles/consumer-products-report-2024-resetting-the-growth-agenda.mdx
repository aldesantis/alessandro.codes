## Summary

Consumer products companies are facing uncertain demand and are in need of resetting their growth agendas. The industry experienced tremendous growth in recent years, but a significant portion of that growth came from price increases rather than volume gains. Rising input costs and inflation have impacted the industry, leading to consumer spending constraints. To achieve profitable, volume-led growth, consumer products companies need to focus on emerging markets, adapt to evolving consumer needs, and address challenges in digitalization and sustainability. Additionally, companies must prioritize stakeholders and strike a balance between economic value creation and positive impact on consumers, customers, employees, and the planet.

## Highlights

- Yet three-quarters of 2023’s growth is likely to have come from price increases rather than volume gains, as CPGs passed on rising input costs to consumers. In the US and Europe, price increases accounted for 95% of RSV growth. That imbalance isn’t sustainable.
- CPGs will also need to identify critical places in which they can become simpler and cope with the additional complexity that’s on the horizon. For instance, consumers are becoming more sophisticated and less uniform. Furthermore, retail continues to fragment, geopolitical uncertainty will demand fresh supply chain investment, and category disruptions won’t be limited to Ozempic.

- Our analysis found that CPGs tend to reward investors more richly if they also have a high level of digital focus (e.g., an emphasis on digital in the strategic agenda, the presence of a digital leader on the executive team and board, and a greater willingness to make investment in tech a priority).
- Between 2018 and 2022, the total shareholder return of the CPGs that ranked in the top quartile for digital focus was about 15 percentage points higher than that of the bottom quartile.
- Our latest research shows that meeting the needs of four key stakeholder groups—consumers, customers, employees, and the planet—doesn’t distract top CPGs from the vital task of creating economic value for investors. On the contrary, such breadth actively supports profitable growth.
- Overall, CPGs can be divided into four categories based on their ability to succeed on both fronts: impact leaders, profit chasers, stakeholder stewards, and laggards (see Figure 4).
