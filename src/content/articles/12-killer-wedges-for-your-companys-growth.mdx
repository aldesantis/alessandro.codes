## Summary

To grow a startup, it’s important to start with a “killer wedge,” which is a specific product feature or small target market that helps you connect with customers quickly. This approach allows you to gather valuable feedback and refine your offerings before expanding into larger markets. Remember, a killer wedge is a stepping stone, not the end goal, so use the insights gained to inform your future growth strategy.

## Highlights

- Large markets aren’t monoliths. Rather, they’re a network of niches. It’s essential to think about how to intelligently move through each of those niches en route to your larger target market.
- Critically, [viral effects are not network effects](https://www.nfx.com/post/viral-effects-vs-network-effects). You will have to build both long-term defensibility, and expand past this initial bubble. Many companies forget or are unable to leverage this momentum.
- Begin by finding a new, non-competitive customer base and offering that to potential supply-side customers. This could be a new geographical market, a different demographic, or a specific customer need not currently met. Use that group to fortify yourself and grow from there.
