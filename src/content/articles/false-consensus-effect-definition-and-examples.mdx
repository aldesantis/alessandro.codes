## Summary

The false consensus effect is when people think their opinions are more common than they really are. Researchers have studied why this happens and found that it can be influenced by motivations and selective exposure. This bias can affect how people perceive others’ behaviors and beliefs.

## Highlights

- The false consensus effect describes the tendency for people to believe that their own opinions, beliefs, and attributes are more common and normative in others than they actually are and that opinions, beliefs, and attributes that others have but they do not share are more indicative of someone’s personality in general.
