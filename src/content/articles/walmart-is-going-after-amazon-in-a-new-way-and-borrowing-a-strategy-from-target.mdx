## Summary

Walmart is adopting a strategy from Target by leveraging its physical stores to fulfill orders for its growing e-commerce business. Target has found success with this approach, and Walmart hopes it will give them an edge in their competition with Amazon.

By utilizing their extensive physical retail presence, Walmart and Target aim to compete with Amazon in terms of speed and delivery capabilities.

## Highlights
