## Summary

To be interesting, be interested

## Highlights

- **One way to be interesting is to be interested**, so when telling someone something you think is interesting, make sure to show them why you find it so compelling, and your enthusiasm will become contagious.
- Wrapping your idea in narrative enables others to engage with it more deeply, understand it more fully, and remember it later. So instead of diving into a direct explanation, tell a story that embodies the truth you want to communicate. Like enthusiasm, storytelling is contagious, and soon youâ€™ll be trading insight-laden tales.
- People who were rated higher by their conversational partners tended to speak fairly quickly, and with more emotional intensity. Also, they tended to use more head movement (nodding for yes and shaking for no) while listening, and showed more facial signs of happiness.
