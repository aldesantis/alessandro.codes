## Summary

The author feels overwhelmed by the many options in life and struggles to focus on one path. She finds inspiration in characters like Julie from “The Worst Person in the World,” who explores different interests without fear. Luisa encourages others to try new things one at a time and to embrace the journey of self-discovery.

## Highlights

- “I can never read all the books I want; I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited.”
