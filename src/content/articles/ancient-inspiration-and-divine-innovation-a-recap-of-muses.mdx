The three-day event included a retail pop-up shop, an exhibition curated by Tam Gryn, thought leadership events, workshops, panel discussions, and a launch party for the annual print Journal, MUSES. The event brought together brand leaders to explore new worlds of commerce and expand their thinking.

## Highlights
- When we poll our audience of C-level executives in the eCommerce industry, their primary business concern is the inability to futureproof their business and manage sustainable growth, and their secondary concern is the lack of imagination and innovation in the channels they have direct control over. Often, this is a website or a web marketplace like Amazon or Walmart.
