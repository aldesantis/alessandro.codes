## Summary

The author questions whether Trump’s broad tariffs fit the law but admits they may be legal and have worked. Tariffs mix trade, national security, and foreign policy, making the issue complex. Simple, absolute takes are misleading; the matter deserves careful, cautious judgment.

## Highlights

- By now, however, critics need to admit that Trump has accomplished more than they expected while incurring less damage than they feared, even if the U.S.’s position relative to China may be relatively unchanged. Indeed, the entire tariff episode should be a clarifying window into American power and how it’s exercised in the modern era: which tools are most powerful, the extent of authority that Americans are vesting in a President with every election, and the areas in which deference to the separation of powers can look anachronistic.
