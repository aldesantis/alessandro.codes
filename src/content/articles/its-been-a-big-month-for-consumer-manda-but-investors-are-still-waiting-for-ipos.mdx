## Summary

Recently, there have been significant mergers and acquisitions in the consumer sector, but no new consumer product IPOs have occurred in 2025. Experts believe more IPOs are essential for the health of consumer businesses, as they offer a strong exit strategy for investors. Current uncertainties around tariffs and consumer sentiment are causing companies to delay their public offerings.

## Highlights

- The reality is that “IPOs are the top of the food chain, when it comes to exits,” Mike Duda, managing partner at investment firm Bullish, said. When there’s a solid IPO, he said, the sentiment around it just sticks in the market longer and “gives people the confidence that it is OK to go out there [and transact].”
- Duda and Dunst both say what’s needed to drive more IPOs this year is more certainty — not just in tariff policy, but also in consumer sentiment, as there are still a lot of questions around how the latter will change through the rest of the year.
