## Summary

Coterie is a luxury diaper brand that has gained popularity for its high absorbency and premium price, positioning itself as a status symbol for parents. Founded by Frank Yu after discovering ultra-absorbent Japanese diapers, Coterie’s subscription model has sparked mixed reactions among consumers. The brand emphasizes a parent-centric marketing approach, focusing on sleep quality and the overall parenting experience rather than just the product itself.

## Highlights

- The high price is a feature, not a bug – it’s one very obvious brand lever in positioning Coterie as a luxury status symbol. As we mentioned in our recent Brands after Vibes essay, parenting is a key contemporary theater for luxury. Coterie is like Artipoppe, or Bugaboo, or private school, but on a baby’s dirty bottom.
- Having turned its consumers into adult babies, DTC branding now turns to actual babies as the final frontier.
