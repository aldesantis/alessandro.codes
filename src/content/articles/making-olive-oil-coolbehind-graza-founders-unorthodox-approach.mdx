## Summary

The leader of the brand known for its squeezy bottles opens up on his business and marketing approach, including his knack for making headlines.

## Highlights
- “Andrew’s personality IS Graza’s personality,” Dushi recently told Ad Age in an email, adding that “half the time, when we are emailing or texting our customers it is just Andrew having fun and messaging them the same way he messages me to ask what I made for dinner. That has led to us earning a ton of trust for the brand, and has played a huge part in Graza's success!”
