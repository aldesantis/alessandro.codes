## Summary

Asking smart questions is essential for leaders in today's unpredictable environment. A mix of different question types, like investigative and interpretive, can help teams explore ideas and make better decisions. By assessing their questioning styles, leaders can uncover critical information and foster a culture of curiosity.

## Highlights
- Advances in AI have caused a seismic shift from a world in which answers were crucial to one in which questions are. The big differentiator is the ability to craft smart prompts.
- Our research reveals that strategic questions can be grouped into five domains: *investigative, speculative, productive, interpretive,* and *subjective.* Each unlocks a different aspect of the decision-making process.
- Successively asking “How?” can also help you transcend generic solutions and develop more-sophisticated alternatives. Investigative questions dig ever deeper to generate nonobvious information. The most common mistake is failing to go deep enough.
- Whereas investigative questions help you identify and analyze a problem in depth, speculative questions help you consider it more broadly. To reframe the problem or explore more-creative solutions, leaders must ask things like “What if…?” and “What else…?”
- Productive questions help you assess the availability of talent, capabilities, time, and other resources. They influence the speed of decision-making, the introduction of initiatives, and the pace of growth.
- Interpretive questions—sensemaking questions—enable synthesis. They push you to continually redefine the core issue—to go beneath the surface and ask, “What is this problem really about?” Natural follow-ups to investigative, speculative, and productive questions, interpretive questions draw out the implications of an observation or an idea.
- Subjective: What’s Unsaid?
  The final category of questions differs from all the others. Whereas they deal with the substance of a challenge, it deals with the personal reservations, frustrations, tensions, and hidden agendas that can push decision-making off course.

- Team members may be reluctant to explore emotional issues unless the leader provides encouragement and a safe space for discussion. They may fail to share misgivings simply because no one else is doing so—a social dynamic known as *pluralistic ignorance.* Leaders must invite dissenting views and encourage doubters to share their concerns.
- “As your career progresses, you’re offered riskier moves, into jobs you’ve never done, domains you don’t know, and challenges you’ve never experienced….[People] gamble on your ability to ask the questions that will help you learn.”
