## Summary

Strategic approach to ESPRIT's comeback

## Highlights
- fans play a central role in the modern aspirational economy, where stuff is cheap. Status comes from interpretation of culture and the resulting social capital. Fans are masters of interpretation: their goal is not to create anything new, but to interpret existing ideas, trends, styles and looks by making them slightly different than before. Fans comfortably reside in the domain of their own geekiness and play with things for fun and status in their community.
