## Summary

Luck plays a big role in success, but it’s important to focus on what is repeatable rather than purely attributing success to luck. Learning from skills that are repeatable can lead to sustainable success in business and investing. Emulating repeatable lessons from successful individuals like Warren Buffett and Elon Musk can increase your chances of success.

## Highlights

- It’s so important to know the difference between the two when attempting to learn from someone. You want to try to emulate skills that are repeatable. Attempting to copy the parts of someone’s success that aren’t repeatable is equivalent to a 56-year-old dressing like a teenager and expecting to be cool.
- [After the dot-com crash], the lesson people learned from that was not, “I should never speculate on overvalued financial assets.” The lesson they learned was, “I should never speculate on internet stocks.” And so the same people who lost 90% or more of their money day-trading internet stocks ended up flipping homes in the mid 2000s, and getting wiped out doing that. It’s dangerous to learn narrow lessons.
