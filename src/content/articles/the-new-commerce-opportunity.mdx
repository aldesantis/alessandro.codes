## Summary

What buyers and sellers really want

## Highlights
- A complete commerce experience: a) empowers sellers through business and tech tools (e.g. proof of ownership), while also giving them a wide user base; b) gives buyers guidance and community; and c) brings influencers (curators and critics) into the mix as the key players in evaluating and contextualizing goods.

- The new commerce opportunity is to offer buyers ways to easily discover new sellers, to support the sellers they like, to grow their collections, track drop dates, maintain their buyer reputation, share their finds with other buyers and to be entertained.
