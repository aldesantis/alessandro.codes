## Summary

"Species that are more responsive to change can gain a relative advantage over the ones they compete with and increase the odds of survival.

## Highlights
- Whichever route you take, expect a struggle. Finding work you love is very difficult. Most people fail. Even if you succeed, it's rare to be free to work on what you want till your thirties or forties. But if you have the destination in sight you'll be more likely to arrive at it. If you know you can love work, you're in the home stretch, and if you know what work you love, you're practically there.
- It's more advantageous to structure decisions to be easily reversible than to take too much time trying to make the perfect choice.
- Understanding how environments impact performance changes how you hire. Employees who thrive in one environment easily fail in another if their performance was contingent on the workplace conditions. This is why hiring a superstar away from a competitor, without understanding the role of environment on performance, often fails.
