## Summary

Building a brand-centric organization requires bridging the gap between short-term and long-term thinking. This involves embedding brand strategy and management across different departments and functions, rather than just relegating it to marketing. Brand management encompasses product design, merchandising, retail, media, and cultural influence. It requires organizational cooperation, nimble project management, and a portfolio approach to brand actions. By synchronizing all brand actions and constantly renewing consumers’ brand perception, a brand can protect its pricing power and remain relevant in a competitive market.

## Highlights

- Long-term thinking prioritizes the full-funnel, maintains strategic vs tactical view, gives time for brand desirability to solidify, and deeply embeds the brand strategy and management across different departments and functions.
- Brand strategy is more than marketing. It is deeply embedded in product design and merchandising, digital and physical retail, and media and cultural influence.
- Brand management is today a strategy of cultural awareness and ampification, an experimental, portfolio approach to brand actions, creation of moments of interest, entertainment production, fandom-building and market expansion.

- Brand management synchronizes all brand actions - from email copy to visual merchandising to design concepts and customer relationship management - across departments and functions. By doing this, it protects a brand’s pricing power; makes a distinction between margin-drivers and volume-drivers when it comes to products, and constantly renews consumers’ brand perception, making the brand relevant.
- Website and stores are synchronized through brand in their visual and user experience design, consistent and recognizable as belonging to a single brand.
