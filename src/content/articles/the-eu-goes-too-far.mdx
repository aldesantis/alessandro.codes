## Summary

European regulators are cracking down on Apple and Google for their business practices. The European Commission is accused of overreaching in its antitrust regulations, potentially harming innovation and competition. Companies like Apple and Meta may face challenges in the E.U. due to regulatory demands.

## Highlights

- Cowen’s point is that while many countries aggressively regulate the price of pharmaceuticals, you ultimately need a profit motive to invest in the massive up-front cost in developing new drugs; that profit comes from the U.S. market. The reason this all works is that the actual production of drugs is similar to technology: once the drug is approved every marginal pill is effectively zero marginal cost; this means that it is worth selling drugs at highly regulated prices, but you still need a reason to develop new drugs as well.
- Fines from a regional regulator are not the equivalent of engineering and server costs that you’re already paying so you might as well capture pennies of extra revenue from said region; they are are directly related to revenue from that region. In other words, they are more like marginal costs: the marginal cost of serving the E.U. is the expected value of the chances you will get fined more than you earned in any given year, and for big tech that price is going up.
