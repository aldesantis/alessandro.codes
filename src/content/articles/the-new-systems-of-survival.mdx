## Summary

The text discusses two cultural mindsets, represented by LinkedIn (hypernormalcy) and Twitter (weirdness). People who lean towards hypernormalcy value established career paths, while those who prefer weirdness embrace unconventional ideas and signals. The author suggests that both mindsets are increasingly influencing each other in today's evolving social landscape.

## Highlights
- My system of survival is to make a home in hypernormal spaces, but with frequent travel to weird spaces.
