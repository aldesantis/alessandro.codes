## Summary

“If we can’t work smarter, we resort to working harder. We cut out lunch, skip the gym, and run from one meeting to another so we can fit more in.

## Highlights

- “The test of a business man is not whether he can make money in one or two boom years, or can make money through the luck of getting into the field first, but whether in a highly competitive field, without having any initial advantage over his competitors, he can outdistance them in a perfect honourable way and keep the respect of himself and of his community.”
- There is a certain category of decisions that work well in the classroom but not in real life. I call these chalkboard decisions. These decisions tease us because the math always seems correct.
- “If your aspirations are outgrowing your net worth, that’s when people get into trouble. If your net worth grows 10%, but your expectations grow 12%, that’s when you get into trouble.”
