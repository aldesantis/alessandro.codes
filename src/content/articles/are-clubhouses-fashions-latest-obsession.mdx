## Summary

Luxury fashion brands like Bottega Veneta and ZEGNA are creating immersive clubhouses to engage loyal customers and expand brand experiences beyond traditional stores. These clubhouses aim to foster connections, showcase brand culture, and prioritize loyalty over immediate sales. The fashion industry is exploring new strategies like Web3 loyalty programs and rethinking luxury e-commerce to adapt to changing consumer demands.

## Highlights
- Many luxury brands fail to cultivate a genuine community, often confusing top spenders and paid celebrities with true community members.
- **For new entrants like Bottega Veneta and ZEGNA to succeed, they must remember to not deliver a brand monologue but that success hinges on creating a two-way dialogue around something bigger than shopping.** That’s of course if they want their “community” to return time and time again.
