## Summary

In this article titled “Foresight as Activism: Researching vs. Making Culture,” the author discusses the importance of actively participating in culture rather than solely researching it. They argue that market research and trend-fetishism are self-centered and that brands should collaborate with communities to create preferred futures. The article emphasizes the need for marketers to understand and engage with existing communities, contemplate equitable and sustainable outcomes, and make investments and partnerships to bring about change. Several examples are provided to illustrate how brands have successfully worked with communities to create positive impact. The article concludes by stating that the future of strategy lies in actively shaping the world alongside others.

## Highlights

- “We don’t know anything. Ultimately, there are far more good ideas we can post-rationalize than there are good ideas we can pre-rationalize. So why make the ability to rationalize something a prerequisite for trying something?”
- In other words, why make research a precondition for what could be possible? After all, we don’t know how to measure what we care about, and only care about what we can measure… all of which is just the past anyway. Research is an ouroboros, a snake eating its own tail. Our strategies can be rationalized by our own desires for a world we want to see, but does not yet exist.

- Right now, companies are developing digital twin models of audiences so brands can A/B Test messaging before putting it out into the real market. But this costly software wouldn’t be necessary if organizations were active participants in the cultures or markets they were so keen to resonate with.
