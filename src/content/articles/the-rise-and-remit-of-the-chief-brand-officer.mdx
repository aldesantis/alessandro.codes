## Summary

The rise of the Chief Brand Officer (CBO) complements the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) in recognizing the importance of customer engagement in brand-building. Companies are investing in unique branded experiences across customer touchpoints to differentiate themselves in a technology-driven, fragmented market. The CBO acts as a brand-driven change agent, collaborating with the CMO to enhance customer engagement and build brand loyalty in a diverse, omnichannel landscape.

## Highlights

- The world’s greatest companies offer a unique, branded experience that invites the customer into a “brand dance”—an inviting, multisensory experience that is purposefully designed to engage customers emotionally, to deliver feelings of delight, accomplishment and appreciation, on a one-to-one basis.
- An effective CBO defines the brand, its personality and signature behavioral characteristics, and uses this brand strategy to engage all functions touching the customer. It may start with marketing and advertising, but it extends to legal, technology, product development and innovation teams—even HR and customer service
