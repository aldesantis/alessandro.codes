## Summary

Many potential customers may express interest in a product but still choose not to buy it, leading to a situation called “Product Purgatory.” This happens when the product lacks urgency or is not a top priority for the customer, even if it passes the “Magic Wand Test” of desirability. To overcome this, businesses should focus on identifying customers with immediate needs or pressing issues that the product can solve.

## Highlights

- If the product delivers any value whatsoever, you might as well take it, right? No, because all products not only create friction in implementation, but risk and time and money, often on-going, and the Magic Wand Test proves it. The value of the product must _significantly exceed_ this activation energy.
- In the real world the Magic Wand doesn’t exist; even if the price is fair, there are real costs and disruption of implementation and training and integration, and people simply getting used to a new user interface and processes and therefore being unproductive for a while. Product inventors revel in all the value they generate, but don’t see the penalties that they incur. The customers, however, see.
- Furthermore, it’s not good enough for value to merely exceed penalty; the value must be _far larger_ than the penalty. If the value is only slightly larger, it’s not worth engaging, not worth the money, not worth the risk. [Change is difficult](https://longform.asmartbear.com/change/) and [time is limited](https://longform.asmartbear.com/prioritization/); customers cannot spend their time on things that have only minor impact.
- This is the source of Product Purgatory. You [got so many things right](https://longform.asmartbear.com/problem/)—the problem exists, the customer knows it, the customer has budget, the customer has the desire… but there’s no urgency, no reason it has to be done now. **Urgency is the missing ingredient.**
- In general, you solve Purgatory by further narrowing your target market with a condition of “…and needs it right now.” You then target all marketing, sales, and new product features to that [ideal customer profile](https://longform.asmartbear.com/icp-ideal-customer-persona/).
