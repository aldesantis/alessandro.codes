## Summary

You are always internalizing the culture around you. Even when you wish you didn’t. So you better surround yourself with something you want inside—curate a culture.

## Highlights
- You are *always* internalizing the culture around you. Even when you wish you didn’t. So you better surround yourself with something you want inside—curate a culture.
- By replacing a peer group that is low-skilled (such as a peer group in a school) with one that is exceptional (such as Mersenne’s mathematical salon), we can leverage our human capacity to internalize our culture to foster exceptional talent.
- The milieu around you—which shapes you, and which you shape in turn—we can model as a *directed graph*. The nodes are people and objects and ideas connected to each other. And the graph is *directed* because you have *nodes that send you input* and *nodes you send output to.*

- In the split second before speaking, we project ourselves into the position of our addressee, imagine how they will take what we’re about to say, then adjust our communication to fit those expectations. This mechanism, performed in milliseconds, leads us to utter not what we’d intended, but an edited version that accounts for—protects against—the ways that the psychic representation of our addressee thinks and feels.
- To write what I was meant to write, I had to find another audience, which —because I didn’t know how to curate a milieu yet—meant I had to spend the better part of a decade isolated. It was bleak but necessary. Even now, having found you, I need to return to that solitude from time to time. Or else I lose myself.
