## Summary

Retailers face a complex fulfillment landscape with multiple distribution channels and customer expectations for transparency and control. Traditional order management systems are outdated and unable to handle this complexity, leading to inefficiencies and frustrated customers. Modern order orchestration solutions are essential for retailers to optimize inventory, improve customer experiences, and stay competitive.

The eCommerce websites of retailers and brands will in essence never be as important again as they were yesterday as demand increasingly fragments and consumers now discover and purchase products across an expanding range of touch-points - social commerce platforms, third-party marketplaces, direct-to-consumer (DTC) websites, in-store experiences, and soon likely agentic and conversational experiences.
