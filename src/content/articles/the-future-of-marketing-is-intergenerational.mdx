## Summary

The focus of marketers, employers, and policymakers on younger age groups is shifting as older Americans become a significant consumer market. Companies need to stop overlooking older consumers and avoid relying solely on generational stereotypes. Instead, they should embrace individuality, leverage real-time data, and recognize the influence of intergenerational relationships. By creating ageless and post-generational brands that bridge generational gaps, companies can remain relevant and successful in the ever-evolving consumer landscape.

## Highlights

- The obsession with generations is a peculiarly American habit that made sense when comparing the Greatest Generation, who grew up during the Depression and fought in World War II, with the Baby Boomers, who were born into affluence. Such a gargantuan contrast is absent when comparing Millennials and Gen Z.
- Most importantly, generations exist only in our imagination. The [extensive research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343888626_Generations_and_Generational_Differences_Debunking_Myths_in_Organizational_Science_and_Practice_and_Paving_New_Paths_Forward) undertaken by marketers and social scientists, as reviewed by researchers at Wayne State, DePaul, George Washington, and Leipzig universities, shows that the boundaries between generations are fuzzy, if not arbitrary.
- Think of consumers as individuals, not members of an (imaginary) generation. Increasingly, people prefer to be treated as [individuals](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2019/03/13/in-the-era-of-individuality-how-can-brands-create-successful-relationships-with-their-customers/?sh=6345cdad7853).
- Brands can win from [bridging](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescontentmarketing/2021/10/15/how-to-bridge-the-age-gap-in-marketing/?sh=142447a467fd) rather than segmenting generations. Craft an uplifting message that brings people together.
- People’s needs do change as they grow older. But products can be [designed](https://www.system-concepts.com/insights/product-design-and-the-ageing-population/) in such a way that they serve the needs of a wide spectrum of age groups.
- A first step is to become an “ageless” brand, one that emphasizes common values across different age groups. But the destination must be to be build “post-generational” brands, that is, to create a narrative that allow for generations influencing each other’s preferences and purchases through their interaction.
