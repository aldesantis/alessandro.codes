## Summary

The rise of AI could lead to a surge in fake online interactions, making it harder to trust who we communicate with. As a result, people might start to log off from the internet and seek more verified and private social experiences. This shift may also spark a cultural movement towards offline living, although some may become even more immersed in online worlds.

## Highlights

- The surest sign of a market for lemons is when everything for sale is garbage, _and_ nobody has an incentive to put something up for sale that’s _not_ garbage, because they have no way to credibly signal _their_ offerings aren’t garbage, too.
- Sexual selection will cause entire swaths of the coming generations to just not reproduce due to various addictions. But that kind of “evolved resistance” to super-stimulus takes time and is pretty brutal, and culture will co-evolve on a much faster timescale. Cultures that prioritize family, community, regular face-to-face human interaction, strong social support networks, and especially those that have a built-in system for helping young people find spouses, will do better than those that don’t.
- **Seventh,** real estate prices will continue to rise. This is for two reasons – first anyone who participates in the literal version of “The Great Logging Off” will put a huge premium on face-to-face close-knit human community, creating demand for the best locations where dense housing with lots of amenities are available. Second, Ricardo’s Law of Rent observes that whenever human productivity increases, those productivity gains tend to get soaked into the price of real estate in the form of rising rents.
