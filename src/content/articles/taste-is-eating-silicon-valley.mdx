## Summary

The article argues that taste is now more important than software in Silicon Valley, as the lines between technology and culture blur. Founders need to focus on design, branding, and user experience to succeed, while investors are looking for companies that resonate culturally. In this new landscape, products are seen as emotional touchpoints that reflect users' values and identities.

## Highlights
- ***Everyone’s software is good enough.*** ***Software used to be the weapon, now it’s just a tool.***
- ***Taste is eating software. Taste is the new weapon.***
  Whether in design, branding, or user experience, taste now defines how a product is perceived, felt, and adopted (whether it’s software or hardware or both).
- Investors can no longer just fund the best engineering teams and wait either.
  They’re looking for teams that can capture cultural relevance and reflect the values, aesthetics, and tastes of their increasingly diverse markets. How do investors position themselves in this new landscape? They bet on taste-driven founders who can capture the cultural zeitgeist. They build their own personal and firm brands too. They redesign their websites, write manifestos, launch podcasts, and join forces with cultural juggernauts.
- Code is cheap. Money now chases utility wrapped in taste, function sculpted with beautiful form, and technology framed in artistry.
- ‘Good taste is better than bad taste, but bad taste is better than no taste.’
- Products are no longer just functional tools; they are emotional touchpoints. Increasingly, products are designed as vehicles of self-expression and social signaling, reflecting your values, lifestyle, and identity.
