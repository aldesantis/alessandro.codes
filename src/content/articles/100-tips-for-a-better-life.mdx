## Summary

This text provides 100 tips for leading a better life, covering aspects like productivity, success, rationality, self-awareness, relationships, and compassion. It emphasizes the importance of simplicity, dependability, self-understanding, and treating others with compassion and patience. The tips aim to help individuals navigate life's complexities and improve their overall well-being.

## Highlights
- Sometimes unsolvable questions like “what is my purpose?” and “why should I exist?” lose their force upon lifestyle fixes. In other words, seeing friends regularly and getting enough sleep can go a long way to solving existentialism.
- Sturgeon’s law states that 90% of everything is crap. If you dislike poetry, or fine art, or anything, it’s possible you’ve only ever seen the crap. Go looking!
- Some types of sophistication won’t make you enjoy the object more, they’ll make you enjoy it less. For example, wine snobs don’t enjoy wine twice as much as you, they’re more keenly aware of how most wine isn’t good enough. Avoid sophistication that diminishes your enjoyment.
