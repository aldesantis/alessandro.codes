## Summary

The Digital Garden Terms of Service outlines a space for sharing incomplete thoughts and learning in public, encouraging feedback and collaboration. It emphasizes the importance of being open to criticism while allowing for imperfection and growth. The goal is to create a supportive environment that fosters personal knowledge and idea exchange among learners.

## Highlights

- It is in part a trick for creators to play on themselves: For perfectionists who stress over shipping anything less-than-polished and therefore never ship anything, it is a license to trade off self review for peer review and increased velocity.
- Words can take on extra weight with context. Serif fonts and professional design can imply the journalistic standards of the New York Times, yet nobody assigns authority to words on a 4chan or Reddit anonymous discussion forum.
- If you keep your ego small, you can learn more by **explicitly inviting people to criticise your work**.
