## Summary

Put on Surfaris’ classic Wipe Out, put on your swimsuit, get in the sun (or under a sun lamp), and bear with me while we explore the cocktail that arguably launched an entire faux cuisine and milieu to the upper echelons of American culture, a whole new category of drinks.

## Highlights
- DXP was a narrative and a sales motion to attempt to make the whole seem important - to cross-sell and up-sell into the other solutions, though again with modest real results.
- DXPs cost too much to implement, cost too much to license, and present too much risk to adopt. Today’s businesses need far more agility, flexibility, and openness than these integrated suites can provide.
