## Summary

Mytheresa is a luxury fashion retailer that focuses on personalized service for its top clients, generating a significant portion of its revenue from a small group of very important customers. The company has recently acquired Yoox Net-a-Porter, aiming to expand its reach and enhance customer loyalty. CEO Michael Kliger emphasizes the importance of understanding client needs to provide a tailored shopping experience.

## Highlights

- t’s the team from Mytheresa that have become friends. They build relationships. And this is very important, because nowadays you can buy anything everywhere. So to make you a loyal client, you need to feel special.
- But I have stayed with Mytheresa the longest because it is so comfortable to work with them in terms of ordering — the orders, returning or changing and any kind of communication. It is very quick, very exact and they are coming back to me very fast, solving all the problems that could happen. So I’ve only stuck with Mytheresa. When I was introduced to my personal shopper, it made my shopping even easier and more and more comfortable. It made it enjoyable. We communicate online through messages and calls, and she once even came to Spain to congratulate me with flowers before an event.
