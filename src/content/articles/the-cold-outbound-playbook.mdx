## Summary

The Cold Outbound Playbook teaches how to write effective cold emails that can reach potential clients and generate revenue. It emphasizes the importance of email deliverability and provides strategies for warming inboxes and personalizing emails using AI. The goal is to automate the emailing process while maintaining a personal touch, ensuring successful outreach at scale.

## Highlights
- • If the company is less than 50 people, you can and should email the founder.
  • If the company is 50-100+, you could email the founder but should also email other decision-makers.
  • If you’re not sure who’s the decision-maker, email the person who is higher up.
  • Unless the company is very small, you can and should email multiple people at the company.
- In the 1000s of campaigns we’ve run at Aurora, there is one common denominator: the best emails frame the product as a profit center.
- You can’t win a debate without well-structured arguments. In the world of cold outbound, most people don’t know this and their ideas are poorly structured. Here’s a helpful contention format you can use to strengthen your ideas.
  **Claim**: The perspective you have. 
  **Warrants**: Logic explaining why that perspective is valid. 
  **Evidence**: Credible data backing up the claim. 
  **Impact**: Why the claim matters to your prospect.
- There is no one universal template that will make you millions of dollars. But, most great cold emails do have the following elements in them, not necessarily in this order:
  • Personalization 
  • Strong claim 
  • Evidence for that claim 
  • A clear next step 
  • Shorter than ~200 words
- **Write good subject lines**: My best rule for writing good subject lines is that they feel like they could be the subject lines of an internal email—this helps them feel natural in the inbox. For example, “Quick question”, or “Idea for better outbound” are two casual, natural-feeling subject lines. Of course, A/B test in your sequencer to see what works.
