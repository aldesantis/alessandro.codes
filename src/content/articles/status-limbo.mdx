## Summary

Status limbo is a state of uncertainty about your status and future. It can be voluntary or involuntary, leading to personal growth and exploration. Leaving status limbo can bring clarity and a sense of relief.

## Highlights
- Status limbo is a state of ambiguity and future uncertainty about your status, both in your estimation and as perceived by others.
- Writers, musicians, actors, directors, entrepreneurs must all do their time in *status limbo*. And you don’t know how long that time will be. How well you tolerate this state can be the “winning” difference between you and someone just as talented and hard-working as you.
- *The more status you have, the more you may feel yourself giving it up.* That’s the price that comes with the privilege of your starting position. Are you willing to pay it?
