## Summary

Fashion brands are under pressure to enhance supply chain transparency, with digital product passports (DPPs) becoming mandatory in the EU by 2030. Nobody’s Child, an early adopter, is implementing DPPs to provide detailed product data, although they face challenges in data collection and supplier cooperation.
