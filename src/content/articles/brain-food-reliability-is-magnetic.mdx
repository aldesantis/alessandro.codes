## Summary

Small advantages compound over time like interest in a bank account, so being 10% more committed doesn’t give you 10% better results; it gives you 10x better results.

## Highlights

- Reliability is magnetic because humans are hardwired to avoid risk, so once you prove yourself trustworthy and reliable, you become the default choice for opportunities without ever asking for them.
- The longer your memos, the less likely they are to be read by men who have the power to act on them.
