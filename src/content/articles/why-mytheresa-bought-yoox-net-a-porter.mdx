## Summary

Mytheresa is acquiring Yoox Net-a-Porter (YNAP) from Richemont, aiming to strengthen its position in luxury e-commerce. This merger will allow Mytheresa to combine its profitable business model with YNAPâ€™s larger platform while maintaining their distinct brands. The deal is expected to help reduce customer acquisition costs and increase sales, ultimately positioning Mytheresa as a leader in the luxury online market.

## Highlights

- The influx of luxury e-tailers in the last 20 years has given brands a range of partners to help grow and consumers several marketplaces with differentiated offerings to explore. But these platforms lost their edge by carrying similar labels and competing on price, causing their margins to suffer and brands to invest more in driving shoppers to their direct selling channels, where they can control pricing and communication with customers.
- But online luxury could benefit from reduced saturation, where direct competition on price has made it harder for retailers and brands to grow profitably and a return to differentiation, said Stefano Martinetto, founder of brand management firm Tomorrow, which owns popular labels like Martine Rose, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy and A-Cold-Wall.
