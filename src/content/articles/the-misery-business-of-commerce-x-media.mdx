## Summary

Business media for the commerce trade is in a serious state of flux.

## Highlights

- The more media you produce, the more you become consumed by the business of media itself. For “business operators” claiming expertise in the current eCommerce landscape, there’s an expiration date on their point of view. Eventually, that perspective becomes divided with the business of creating attention.
- Having a particular worldview and _examining commerce through that lens_ is what all media founders should be doing (in my humble opinion); which means you must tap into culture as much as you dispense opinions about ad account structure.
