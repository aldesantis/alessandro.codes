## Summary

In a startup, the CEO is like a mountain guide, providing a vision and direction for the team. People often confuse their interpretations of events with facts, leading to misunderstandings. To avoid this, it’s important to recognize when you’re making up stories and to focus on the actual facts instead.

## Highlights

- The second thing to take away is that people are _especially prone_ to making up stories when there are missing facts. For example, if I’m late to a meeting, you don’t know why I’m late. You know I’m not there. So until you can get more information, you have to sit there not knowing. And people hate not knowing. So we make up a story to avoid living in the scary Land of Unknowing.
  The third thing to take away is that the key is to begin to notice **when you’re making up stories**. I like to call this “noticing when you’re living in Meaning Land instead of Fact Land.” People are almost always (but not _**always**__)_ living in the Land of Meaning when they’re feeling negative emotions toward or about themselves, other people, or circumstances.
