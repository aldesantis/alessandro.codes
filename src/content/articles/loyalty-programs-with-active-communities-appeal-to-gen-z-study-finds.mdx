## Summary

Loyalty programs that create a strong emotional connection and active communities attract more users, especially Gen Z. People join for rewards like points, discounts, and personalized offers, but they stay for the sense of engagement and belonging. Brands must focus on building connections, not just transactions, to keep customers loyal.

## Highlights

- Eighty percent of men, 81% of millennials and 75% of Gen Z consumers consider engaging with others in a loyalty program to be extremely important.
- While engagement is important, the report found consumers also associate loyalty programs with value, which remains the top reason for signing up.
