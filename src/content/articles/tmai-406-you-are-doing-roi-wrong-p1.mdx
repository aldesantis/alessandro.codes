## Summary

Marketing measurement is complicated, making it difficult for executives to trust ROI reported by the Marketing team. Different measurement approaches like Last Click ROI, Multi-Touch Attribution ROI, and Channel Silo Incrementality ROI offer varying perspectives on marketing effectiveness and impact. Understanding these measurement methods can help optimize marketing strategies and budget allocation for better outcomes.

## Highlights

- Channel Silo incrementality is a narrower version of the above question. At Level 1 of incrementality measurement, it answers the question:
  _We invest $12 mil buying Brand Keywords on Bing, and received 12,000 Conversions.**
  Would we be minus 12,000 Conversions, if we cut the Bing budget to $0?_
  No, of course not.
