## Summary

Scott Gallowayâ€™s education company, Section, has put together an incredible free library of AI business frameworks you can use to shape your AI strategy.

## Highlights
- Try to not show a negative review among the first, most visible reviews you show (e.g. by simply showing the most recent reviews first).
  Update the rules of which reviews you show first (e.g. most relevant, not most recent), quickly address negative reviews, and - of course - offer excellent quality and service.
  When people see a negative review among your first reviews they will be much less likely to buy - even if your average rating is excellent.
