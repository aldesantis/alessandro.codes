## Summary

In 2023, direct-to-consumer (DTC) brands shifted their focus from solely direct sales to partnering with retail partners to drive sales. This shift was driven by the need to boost brand awareness and reduce digital ad spend. While wholesale is typically seen as lower margin, the increased retail presence allows DTC brands to cut back on marketing expenses. However, some DTC brands, like On, continue to prioritize direct sales and are expanding their physical footprint through store expansion. Overall, the trend in 2023 was a move towards multichannel retail strategies for DTC brands.

## Highlights

- While wholesale is conventionally seen as lower margin than direct sales—because retail partners get a share of the profits—a bigger retail presence boosts brand awareness, which is allowing some DTC brands to cut back on digital ad spend.
