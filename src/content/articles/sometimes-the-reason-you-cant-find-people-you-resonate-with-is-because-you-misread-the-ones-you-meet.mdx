## Summary

Sometimes we misjudge people we meet, missing out on deep connections. The author reflects on how he overlooked a close friend’s true character for years by only seeing him in limited contexts. Genuine friendships require open dialogue and a willingness to explore each other’s personalities beyond first impressions.

## Highlights

- A person can’t be contained in your ideas about them. This was a core idea for us. To whatever extent I assumed I knew who Johanna was, I treated her as something that I could fit in my head — as something smaller than me. But she couldn’t fit in my head, nor I in hers: that was the exciting thing about it. You can only ever know another individual if you meet them in open dialogue — if you treat them as _unfinished_, as capable of surprise.
- If someone seems boring to you, or a bad fit, it might be that you don’t know how to prompt them, that you haven’t seen them react to the context that brings out their full being. You probably don’t know how much beauty lies hidden in the people around you.
