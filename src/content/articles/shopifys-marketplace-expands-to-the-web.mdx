## Summary

Shopify's marketplace is now available on the web, and from afar, it looks like Amazon or any other online retailer. The new marketplace allows shoppers to search and buy all products hosted on Shopify.

## Highlights

The Shop app and Shop Pay are the core pillars of that. With the marketplace functionality in place, that furthers it along.
