## Summary

In the essay, the author discusses why multi-brand loyalty programs don’t work and proposes repositioning them as ‘customer acquisition communities’. They explore consumer and brand desires, failures of loyalty coalitions, and provide a case study on the successful ClassPass approach. The author also touches on the concept of counter-culture cool.

## Highlights

- **Loyalty coalitions have failed repeatedly because participating brands feel they are giving (brand value) more than they are getting — and are losing (hard-earned loyalty consumers) to other competitive brands.** _**This is always going to be a negative value proposition.**_
