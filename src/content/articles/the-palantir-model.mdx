## Summary

The future of strategy is embedding skilled people inside organisations to learn how they really work. Those people diagnose messy, political problems and build bespoke, systemised solutions rather than selling off‑the‑shelf products. The real product is captured understanding — encoded into reusable patterns and internal capability.

## Highlights

- The agency model was never designed for this. It was built for problems with clear edges - a brief, a channel, a campaign, a measurement framework. Neat boxes. But the problems now don’t have edges. They’re tangled. Political. They bleed across departments, sit in the gaps between job descriptions, hide inside legacy systems and unspoken tensions. No brief captures them. No scope of work contains them. And no conveyor belt can solve them.
