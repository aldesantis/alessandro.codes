## Summary

The author reflects on the impact of the pandemic on his perception of “normalcy” at Singapore’s Changi Airport. He struggles with balancing the idea of a return to normal with the reality of ongoing change. Ultimately, he concludes that there is no fixed concept of “normal” and advises embracing the present moment.

## Highlights

- I’ve begun telling myself that there is no normal. I tell myself there is no _future_ normal. There is no _return to a normal_. There is only what is happening now.
