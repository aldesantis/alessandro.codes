## Summary

We experience polarities in leadership all the time, often without even realising. How can you navigate competing tensions harmoniously?

## Highlights
- A polarity is a **paradoxical situation in which two interdependent and seemingly contradictory states must be maintained for success over time**.
- From an evolutionary perspective, the brain is masterful at either/or thinking, and it doesn’t like the nebulousness of both/and.
- The most effective way to build the muscle of spotting polarities is to create the habit of simply pausing when in a problematic situation and asking “Could there be a polarity here?” We are wired to jump to action, and many of us are experts at doing it quickly! When faced with any issue, simply taking the time to consider whether or not it is a polarity is a crucial step.
