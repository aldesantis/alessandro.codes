## Summary

Welcome to the Sociology of Business. In my last analysis, How to sell to the Creative Class, I detailed implementation of audience-driven growth through the four Creative Class segments.

## Highlights

- For this transcendence to happen, different areas of cultural production need to fuse. Tourism and branding, film and television, gaming and fashion, art and design, architecture and content creation, and advertising and publishing are becoming [a single brand narrative](https://substack.com/redirect/fcc880f8-2a1c-41ff-b8dc-b105aa211bd9?j=eyJ1Ijoib2c5aHAifQ.7_veosXfwdmZrX0yINDOEFjXGdRZd_FMZEjAxf65W7c).
- Today’s new capitalists and traders are journalists, curators, critics, imitators, dealers and hangers-on. They move ideas around, propagate narratives, make connections, assign value to things and direct the consumer market’s attention.
- This is why the members of the Creative class who are at the helm of brands - like fashion designers, film directors, hoteliers, writers, luxury CEOs - are getting frequently replaced. To keep going, the creative economy needs interpretative newness.
