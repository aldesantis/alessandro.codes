## Summary

People often reason at the wrong level of abstraction and misuse ideas from one level to make decisions at another. Complex adaptive systems have many levels where rules and solutions don’t transfer directly. To make better choices, seek ideas at the level just above or below the one you’re acting on.

## Highlights

- be suspicious of ideas that are taken from one level of a complex adaptive system and are then applied to a higher (or lower) level. It is likely that they aren’t as useful as you might imagine them to be.
- “when reasoning about your career, think one level above, or one level below.” Or, as he puts it more succinctly: “think ‘plus or minus one!’”
- We think we’re being smart. We think we can extrapolate up and down the causal chain, across multiple levels in a complex adaptive system. And perhaps some of us are truly genius enough to do so. But most of the time, I suspect that we’re just acting a part: we think we’re demonstrating intelligence … but we’re simply playing with ideas at the wrong level of abstraction.
