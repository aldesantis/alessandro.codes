## Summary

A media ecosystem that focuses on engagement vs. enlightenment will get you to whatever conclusion sanctifies your beliefs.

## Highlights

- Our efficiency comes at the cost of accuracy: Many instinctual decisions will be poorly calibrated (i.e., wrong). To facilitate the requisite speed, our brain buttresses our decisions with artificial confidence. Kahnemanâ€™s body of work demonstrates that we are often wrong but frequently confident.
- The healthy profit margins of insurance companies reflect our tendency to overestimate the likelihood of calamities.
- There were real gains to happiness in moving from $100,000 income to $200,000, but to see that same gain again required another doubling of income to $400,000. Extend the curve, and it flattens further.
- According to the IRS, [26,576](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1304.pdf#page=51) U.S. households reported income of over $10 million in 2020, totalling $824 billion in income. We collected $210 billion income tax from these filers, or 25% of their income. If we collected an additional 25% of just the income over $10 million, there would be little impact on the lifestyle or happiness of these taxpayers.
