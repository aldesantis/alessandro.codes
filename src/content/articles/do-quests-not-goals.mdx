## Summary

David Cain suggests replacing traditional goals with a "quest" mentality to inspire personal growth and achievement. Quests are seen as adventures that transform you, helping to overcome internal obstacles while pursuing aspirations. By tackling these personal challenges alongside daily life, you can create meaningful change without waiting for a better time.

## Highlights
- **A quest changes you, not just your situation.** Goals are practical attempts to change your circumstances. A quest is personally transformative – the endeavor itself shapes who you are, and what you’re capable of.
