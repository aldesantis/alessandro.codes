## Summary

The document explores the history and variations of the Corpse Reviver cocktail, highlighting its popularity and the different recipes that have emerged over time. It also delves into the concept of composability in legacy commerce platforms and whether they can be revived through this approach. The article discusses the challenges faced by legacy platforms, including their large install bases, integration into larger suites, outdated paradigms, and a focus on existing customers rather than innovation. Composability is defined as a component-based solution design approach that allows for easier integration and customization of third-party solutions with the core platform. The document concludes that while legacy platforms have announced composability initiatives, the promise of the concept has yet to be fully realized.

## Highlights

- The reality today - across essentially all these platforms - is that composability is a promise yet to be paid off. Integration with apps is still painful, requiring development work to manage data-models and data-flows, and is often supported with batch processes (yes, I am looking at you CSV).

- With the democratization and standardization of modern application development on top of public cloud infrastructure continues, more and more large IT shops inside large organizations are seeking to build versus buy. These are savvy, proud organizations with resources and the burning desire to differentiate.
