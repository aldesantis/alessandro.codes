# The wellness industry promotes unfairness

In [[readwise/Articles/Tiny Stupid Habits]], Rosie Spinks argues that the wellness industry is inherently unfair because it proposes individualized solutions for structural problems: breathing more cannot be the answer to the ever-increasing anxiety that we all feel due to economic and social pressures and inequalities.

This is especially true because most of the people who would benefit from breathing are people who cannot afford to take time to breathe in the first place.
