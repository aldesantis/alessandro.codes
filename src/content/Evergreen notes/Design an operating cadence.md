# Design an operating cadence

Organizations that are both fast and stable outperform competitors who only exhibit one of these traits, because [[Structure sets you free]].

You become fast and stable by designing an operating cadence and turning it into muscle memory. The operating cadence is the heartbeat of your org.

When designing an operating cadence, you should make sure to [[Define a meeting OS]], [[Eliminate bias systematically]], and [[Build experimentation guidelines]].

A key part of the operating cadence is to constantly [[Improve the operating cadence]].

Remember, though, that [[An operating cadence needs shared vision]].
