# Sales channels must be integrated

While it’s true that [[Evergreen notes/Every sales channel has its purpose]], you shouldn’t think about channels in isolation. Instead, you should be constantly thinking about how to integrate them so that they support, and not cannibalize, each other.

This can take many different forms. The classic example is a brand that sells both through wholesale partners and on its own DTC channels. In that case, it might be a good idea to sell most of your catalog wholesale and reserve DTC for exclusive drops that will only be interesting to highly engaged customers. Or you could have wholesale customers subscribe to your owned newsletter to receive product updates.

## Counterfactuals

- Is it a good idea to restrict product availability, given that customers will shop where they want to shop regardless of your marketing strategy?
