# Media and commerce are blending

The line of demarcation between media and commerce is fading more and more.

Take a brand like [Liquid Death](https://liquiddeath.com). Is it a CPG company that invests heavily in media as a form of marketing, or is it a media company that monetizes its productions by selling consumer products?

If this trend continues (and everything indicates it will), it may well be that [[Evergreen notes/In the future, commerce will be everywhere]] rather than being confined to an individual platform.
