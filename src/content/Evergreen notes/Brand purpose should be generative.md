# Brand purpose should be generative

We’ve established that [[Evergreen notes/Brands should stand for purpose, not search for it]].

At the same time, it’s essential that your brand purpose does not limit your brand to a specific category. Instead, it should be broad enough to be applied to several categories as part of a coherent and cohesive business strategy.
