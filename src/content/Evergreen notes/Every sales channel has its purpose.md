# Every sales channel has its purpose

You shouldnâ€™t approach all sales channels in the same way. Instead, you should focus on the incremental value that each channel can bring to your brand (e.g., [[Evergreen notes/Wholesale is for breadth, DTC is for depth]]).

Sometimes, sales channels have secondary effects: for example, [[Evergreen notes/Wholesale boosts brand awareness]], which in turn can increase direct-to-consumer revenue. This is also why [[Evergreen notes/Sales channels must be integrated]] rather than adopted in isolation.
