## Outline

### Introducing Experience-Led Commerce

- In our work at Nebulab, we’ve seen first hand how CX can help brands stand out. We’ve begun to call this approach “Experience-Led Commerce” (XLC).
	- Experience-Led Commerce is a systemic and systematic process that brands can adopt to leverage CX to increase revenue and profit, minimize operational costs, or more generally achieve their objectives.
	- XLC does NOT replace performance marketing activities but rather amplifies their impact by helping brands maximize their marketing ROI.
	- XLC can help brands maximize the ROI of their marketing activities.
	- Furthermore, XLC helps brands decouple their value proposition from their product and pricing, allowing them to eschew the race to the bottom ignited by price comparison.
- Caveat that it’s not a panacea: it requires novel skills and significant discipline and resources. However, when done right, it leads to stickier and more durable brands.

### The Five Dimensions of Customer Experience

 - CX is a very broad and abstract term, with everyone giving it a slightly different meaning, often depending what they’re trying to sell.
- You can think about CX across five dimensions:
	- Who:
		- Brand
		- Operator
		- Consumer
	- When:
		- There are six phases to the customer journey:
			- Discovery
			- Consideration
			- Purchase
			- Fulfillment
			- Post-Purchase
			- Retention
		- In turn, each one of these phases is comprised of several touchpoints, which can be:
			- Customer-initiated:
				- Discovery: Using search, asking questions, requesting info
				- Consideration: Reading reviews, comparing products, seeking size advice
				- Purchase: Adding to cart, checkout, resolving payment issues
				- Post-Purchase: Writing reviews, initiating returns, requesting support
				- Retention: Joining loyalty program, sharing referrals, reporting issues
			- Brand-initiated:
				- Discovery: Retargeting ads, welcome emails, promotional content
				- Consideration: Abandoned cart reminders, live chat popups
				- Purchase: Product recommendations, order confirmations
				- Post-Purchase: Shipping updates, feedback requests
				- Retention: Loyalty communications, personalized offers
	- Where (i.e., sales channel):
		- Digital (web, mobile, app, social commerce)
		- Physical (stores, pop-ups, showrooms)
	- Why (i.e., motivations and goals to pursue):
		- Economic Whys (Rational/Financial)
			- Consumer: Value, savings, financial optimization
			- Brand: Growth, profitability, market share
			- Operator: Efficiency, productivity, resource optimization
		- Functional Whys (Practical/Operational)
			- Consumer: Problem-solving, convenience, utility
			- Brand: Product-market fit, operational excellence
			- Operator: Process efficiency, service delivery
		- Aspirational Whys (Identity/Values)
			- Consumer: Self-expression and status, Community belonging, Personal values (sustainability, innovation, ethics)
			- Brand: Brand positioning and differentiation, Community building, Purpose and impact
			- Operator: Professional growth, Team culture, Mission alignment
	- How (i.e., what medium the CX is expressed through):
		- Business (pricing strategy, return policy, loyalty programs, value-added services, value proposition, etc.)
		- Design (branding, UX/UI, visual language, copy, etc.)
		- Technology (infrastructure, platform, tools, etc.)
- You need to understand your CX well across all five dimensions.
- Over time, you need to work on and build synergies across all five dimensions so they’re all perfectly aligned and deliver the same brand message/value prop.
- How to do that exactly? (Leads to the next paragraph.)

### Getting Started with Experience-Led Commerce

#### 1. Collect Data

- What data to collect:
	- Voice of the Customer
	    - Qualitative
	        - Mine and synthesize customer feedback from existing channels:
	            - Product reviews (native, Google, Trustpilot, G2)
	            - Social media listening (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit)
	            - Customer support tickets and chat logs (Zendesk, Gorgias, Gladly)
	            - Post-purchase surveys
	        - Conduct user research to fill knowledge gaps:
	            - 10-20 in-depth customer interviews (30-60 minutes)
	            - 3-5 moderated user testing sessions (using Lookback, UserZoom)
	            - 1-2 diary studies or longitudinal research (optional, using dscout)
	    - Quantitative
	        - Run a customer survey to a representative sample (n=200+)
	            - Measure Net Promoter Score (NPS) and ask key driver questions
	            - Gauge brand awareness, consideration, and perception
	            - Understand product/service likes, dislikes, alternatives
	            - Capture feedback at key moments in the customer journey (post-purchase, renewal)
	        - Analyze results and segment by customer attributes (e.g., demographics)
	        - Compare to industry benchmarks and identify key consistencies/discrepancies
	    - Synthesize the research into 3-5 data-driven personas:
	        - Define psychographics, needs, behaviors, and motivations
	    - Map current-state journeys for each persona:
	        - Uncover context, goals, touchpoints, and moments of truth
	        - Identify points of friction and moments of delight
	        - Capture customer mindset, emotion, and verbatims
	        - Visualize the front-stage experience and back-stage capabilities
	- Stakeholder interviews
	    - Conduct 1:1 interviews with key stakeholders across the organization
	        - Senior leadership (CEO, CMO, CTO, etc.)
	        - Marketing, Sales, Customer Service, Operations leads
	        - Digital product owners
	    - Align on business goals, target audiences, success metrics
	    - Understand current initiatives, challenges, hypotheses
	    - Gather existing research, data, and documentation
	- UX/UI audits
	    - Measure against standard benchmarks (e.g., Baymard)
	    - Measure against the competition
	    - Identify major points of friction and level of effort
	- Digital analytics
	    - Conduct a thorough analysis of all available quantitative data:
	        - Web/app analytics and event tracking (Google Analytics, Adobe, Heap)
	        - A/B testing and personalization (Optimizely, Google Optimize)
	        - Heatmapping tools (Hotjar, FullStory)
	        - Business intelligence and reporting (Looker, Tableau)
	        - Marketing automation and CRM (Klaviyo, Salesforce)
	    - Identify trends, patterns, segments, and anomalies
	    - Form initial hypotheses and areas for further exploration
	- Competitor analysis
	    - Perform a competitive audit of 4-6 key competitors
	        - Heuristic evaluation of competitor websites/apps
	        - Comparison of features, content, pricing, positioning
	        - Mystery shopping and click stream analysis
	    - Identify industry best practices and points of differentiation
	    - Look for whitespace opportunities in the market
	- Market research
	    - Conduct market research to understand broader industry trends: what are the challenges, what are the opportunities, what are the constraints?
	    - If you’re doing -10%, are you still doing better than your competitors? If you’re doing +10%, there’s still a chance you’re doing worse.
- You can’t do it all at the same time. Pick your battles.
- It’s not a one-shot thing—it should be a continuous process. Build your research repository/researchops.

#### 2. Build a Roadmap

- Use AI to synthesize and analyze data.
- Use POAs to evaluate opportunities.
- Build a prioritized roadmap. Possible methodologies:
	- ICE/RICE
	- OST
	- Bottleneck-first
- Roadmap should be long-term enough to allow for long-term thinking but flexible enough to allow for rapid reprioritization.

#### 3. Execute and Validate

- Execute your roadmap.
- Gauge results and use them to inform subsequent work.

### Caveat: CX is NOT a Panacea

- CX is NOT a substitute for business fundamentals (good product, good marketing).
- If you’re only starting out, your focus is likely to be on acquisition.
- That is, unless for some reason you want to make CX a core part of your strategy from day one (e.g., because your positioning is more about experience than product, MBRs, marketplaces, etc.).

### Conclusion

- Quick recap of previous points.
