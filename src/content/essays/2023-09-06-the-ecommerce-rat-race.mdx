If you’ve been following e-commerce news lately and your head is spinning, you should know it’s not you—it’s *them.* The stack of press releases keeps growing by the day. So, just like we spent the last newsletter talking about Shopify’s SMB-vs-enterprise strategy, we’re spending today’s newsletter looking at the broader e-commerce technology landscape.

Here’s the thing: there was a simpler time in this industry when everyone stayed in their lane. Shopify _used to_ be an e-commerce platform for SMBs, Amazon _used to_ be a marketplace, and social networks _used to_ be ad-serving machines. **And for a long time, the pie was growing quickly enough for everyone to be content with this single-threaded strategy.**

It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when this changed: post-pandemic headwinds definitely played a part, but we also believe it has to do with the eCommerce industry maturing and brand operators demanding more sophisticated capabilities of their vendors.

This combination led service providers to pursue a different, more aggressive strategy. This usually means one of two things:

- **Launching new products** for existing customers, helping them succeed, and growing their top line through transaction or service fees.
- **Using their existing products as a wedge to grow into a new market segment** that offers incremental or more predictable revenue.

This isn’t just about revenue, either: **data has always been gold and is even more valuable with the AI renaissance.** The more pieces of the consumer experience you own, the more data you can gather. That data can be used for performance and operational improvements, allowing you to command a greater market share.

We’re seeing more and more of these plays unfolding lately: TikTok and Facebook want to become e-commerce platforms, Amazon wants to win Shopify customers with Buy with Prime, Shopify wants to move upmarket with Commerce Components… **Everyone’s simultaneously imposing their products on the market _and_ letting the market pull new products out of them.**

Time will tell which of these strategies will stand the test of time: honestly, we don’t really see Facebook becoming the new Shopify any time soon.

Still, for all the headwinds this industry has experienced, it’s an exciting time to be in e-commerce. **The constant launches coupled with a pretty fervent M&A landscape mean that the cream is rising to the top**, equipping operators with even more, even better tools to succeed—in most cases, at least
