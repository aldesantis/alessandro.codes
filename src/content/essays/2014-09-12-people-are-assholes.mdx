People are assholes. I think we’ve established that. It’s a fact, not an opinion — and it’s quite widespread. But it’s completely fine: I don’t want them to change. Why would I? Do you ever figure what a boring world it would be if everybody acted in an ideal way? No wars, no fights, no robberies, no poverty, no hunger… What a shithole of a place to live!

And I’m serious. I am! If everything was so great we wouldn’t have anything to laugh about. Do you ever notice how no one laughs about good, positive stuff? It’s not fun. Remember that time at the playground when you saw that little girl, maybe six years old, playing happily with her father? Was it fun? No, it wasn’t! BORING!

But when she passed under a low beam and her father didn’t notice and ran straight into it and cracked his useless fucking head like a coconut and fell into a coma, that was hilarious! I mean, not for her father and not for the girl and not for her family — but you can bet the rest of the world were laughing their asses off.

We love when people fuck things up, don’t we? Especially if they physically hurt themselves! It makes us feel smart, makes us feel special. I don’t know, I always find it kind of liberating when some idiot crashes into a pole on a Saturday night because he’s drunk and he kills himself and all the morons with him. The world just became a better place, why shouldn’t I celebrate?

Besides, being a good person is actually detrimental to the Universe! The Universe needs a little evil, a little chaos now and then.

Suppose you see an abandoned baby on the street. It’s hungry, it’s crying and it just took a massive dump and there’s shit all over the place. No one else has seen you or the baby. What do you do? Do you take it in? Do you leave it there, dying?

Well, if you take it with you, then you’ll have to look after it. And with the crappy care you’re going to provide it with — after all, there’s a reason if you got that abortion two years ago — it’ll most likely turn into a serial killer, chopping you into pieces the size of a tennis ball and feeding them to the ducks as soon as it reaches the age of reason.

Okay, perhaps it wouldn’t be that bad. Perhaps things would turn out just fine: you take care of the child until eventually it becomes one fine young man or woman. So, what do you have now? I’ll tell you what: another asshole! We all are! Do you really want to create another stupid fucking human being? Is it worth it? Haven’t we screwed up enough already? We don’t need help, we’re doing just fine!

But you can’t leave the baby there. You just can’t: it would be so cruel. It would probably suffer for days until death relieved it of the torture. So what can you do? Well, I have a suggestion. Next time you see an abandoned baby on the street, kill it. Put it out of its fucking misery. It’s not like anybody would be willing to take care of it. People are assholes, aren’t they?
