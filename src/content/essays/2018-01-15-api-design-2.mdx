_This is an extract from my book “API on Rails”._

HTTP is cool. Not in a young, hipster-y way. HTTP is the dinosaur of the web: it has been here for almost _forty_ years (HTTP 0.9 dates back to 1980). That’s a lot for this industry: if a standard has survived forty years of evolution, it means the guys behind it have done a pretty good job thinking about how it could be (ab)used not only in their days, but also in the future.

I expect you already know what a request and a response are (if you don’t, you might not be ready for this book just yet) and you have at least a vague understanding of what the place of headers, status codes and methods is in a web application of any kind.

## Methods

Before Rails, `GET` and `POST` were the only two HTTP methods we knew. `GET` was used when clicking on links, `POST` was used for submitting forms and that was about it. Need to create an item? Use `POST`. Need to update an item? Use `POST`. Need to delete an item? Use `POST`. Or `GET`. Whatever, dude, as long as it works.

Rails showed us that there are four HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`. `GET` retrieves a resource, `POST` creates a resource, `PUT` updates a resource, `DELETE` deletes a resource. We finally felt like we were using HTTP at its full potential!

That’s not the entire story, either. The HTTP/1.1 specification lists 9 methods. We’re not going to use all of them: some are meant to be handled by the web server rather than our application. For the sake of completeness, though, I’m going to list them all. Don’t worry if some of the stuff in the table doesn’t make much sense right away: we’ll define it in the next paragraphs.

(\*) Whether the method is generally used when designing and implementing a RESTful API. From now on, these are the only methods we’re going to talk about.

## POST vs. PUT vs. PATCH

The `POST`, `PUT` and `PATCH` methods do similar things, so much so that they’re often confusing for beginners. (Just think about this: by default, Rails 3 would incorrectly accept `PUT` in place of `PATCH` for partially updating resources.) For this reason, it’s worth spending a few extra words on them and their differences.

### POST

`POST` is used when the payload of the request should be processed by the resource at the given URI. This might sound a bit abstract, so let’s try to clarify it with an example:

```http
POST /posts
```

```json
{
  "title": "My new blog post",
  "body": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
}
```

This request asks the server to have the `/posts` resource (which can be thought of as the collection of all posts in the system) accept and process the request entity.

A `POST` request does not necessarily result in a new resource being created (although it does in our example): it can also be used to annotate or append data to an existing resource. Generally speaking, the behavior of a `POST` request is determined by the request URI.

### PUT

The `PUT` method is a bit more predictable than `POST`. It _puts_ - pretty literally - the enclosed entity at the provided URI. Let’s see an example:

```http
PUT /posts/1
```

```json
{
  "title": "My new blog post",
  "body": "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit."
}
```

After this request, the client can assume that `GET /posts/1` will return a representation of the entity that was previous `PUT` (assuming no parallel operations have occurred).

An important distinction between `POST` and `PUT` is that the latter will replace the entity at the given URI if it already exists (unless of course there is an application-level constraint forbidding it).

### PATCH

`PATCH` is used to apply a partial modification to an existing resource and is perhaps the simplest of the methods to comprehend.

For instance, if we wanted to edit the title of an existing post, we could issue the following request:

```http
PATCH /posts/1
```

```json
{
  "title": "My new post title"
}
```

In these cases, `PATCH` is preferred over `PUT` for two reasons:

1. the client might not want or be able to provide the full updated entity and,
2. by sending exclusively the attributes to update, the client can save bandwidth.

## Safety and Idempotence

You might have noticed that some methods are listed as both safe and idempotent, some are not safe but idempotent and some are neither safe nor idempotent.

So, what’s the difference between idempotence and safety? Here are the definitions from [section 9 of RFC 2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html) (the one that defines HTTP/1.1):

> _9.1.1 Safe Methods_
>
> _[…] the convention has been established that the GET and HEAD methods SHOULD NOT have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. These methods ought to be considered “safe”. […]_
>
> _Naturally, it is not possible to ensure that the server does not generate side-effects as a result of performing a GET request […]. The important distinction here is that the user did not request the side-effects, so therefore cannot be held accountable for them._
>
> _9.1.2 Idempotent Methods_
>
> _Methods can also have the property of “idempotence” in that (aside from error or expiration issues) the side-effects of N > 0 identical requests is the same as for a single request. The methods GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE share this property. Also, the methods OPTIONS and TRACE SHOULD NOT have side effects, and so are inherently idempotent._

In other words, a **safe method** is a method that does not hold the user accountable for any modification to the state of the system. For instance, an API might have an endpoint to retrieve the blog post. This would be a safe method. Even if the system incremented a the visit counter for the blog post on every request, this would still be considered a safe call, because the user did not request that the counter be updated and the call does not alter the data significantly.

An **idempotent method**, on the other hand, guarantees that only the first of a set of identical requests will modify the state of the system. You should note that the RFC does not mention the response at all when talking about idempotency: sending the same `DELETE` request twice for the same blog post, for instance, will result in a `200 OK` (or `204 No Content`) on the first time and in a `404 Not Found` on the second, because the post cannot be found. The request is still idempotent because the state of the system was not further modified by the second request.

As you might have noticed, if the visit counter was implemented as previously stated, retrieving a blog post could not be considered strictly idempotent either, since every `GET` request for the blog post would increment the counter (i.e. modify the state of the system). You’ll see that, in practice, some of your implementations will not be completely idempotent (or safe), even if they should be according to the HTTP specification. That’s okay, as long as you don’t forgo idempotency (or safety) in a way that breaks the client’s expectations about the result of their requests.

### Why Is PATCH Non-Idempotent?

You might be confused by the fact that `PATCH` is not included in the list of idempotent methods. After all, modifying the same resource in the same way twice should always yield the same result, right?

Well, `PATCH` is kind of a special snowflake in the HTTP world, in that it is not idempotent by definition, but _can_ be idempotent by implementation.

Suppose that our blog posts API allows us to schedule posts to be published in the future. We can modify the date of a post’s publication with a request like this one:

```http
PATCH /posts/1
```

```json
{
  "published_on": 1479909858
}
```

It requests that the server sets the `published_on` property of the post to `1479909858` (a UNIX time). This kind of `PATCH` request is idempotent, because - no matter if it’s sent one or a million times - the `published_on` property of the post will still be `1479909858` at the end.

But that’s not the only possible implementation of this feature. Suppose our API accepts this kind of request, that postpones the publication of the post by a day:

```http
PATCH /posts/1
```

```json
{
  "published_on": "+1d"
}
```

Can you spot the difference? Unlike the previous one, if we run this request a trillion times, it’s very likely that [no one's going to read our post](http://phys.org/news/2015-02-sun-wont-die-billion-years.html). This is why `PATCH` is not idempotent by definition, even though we can (and should) make it so when implementing it.

## Headers

Since Rails takes care of setting the right headers for us, we rarely stop to think about how we can leverage them to improve our API. HTTP headers, though, are quite useful: you can think of them as a set of metadata attached with a request or response. This metadata can be used by the server (in the case of a request) or the client (in the case of a response) to determine which format and encoding to use, what caching behavior to adopt, what links to follow after the request has completed and much more. We can even specify our very own custom headers (usually prefixed with `X-`).

There are _a lot_ of standard and proprietary, but common, headers that you can use, and listing them all is not very useful nor necessary: you don’t need to know about all of them in order to implement a functional API. However, you should have a look and see which ones you can use to make the experience more pleasant for your users. You can find a full list [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_header_fields). I suggest you skim through it: I can guarantee there will be at least a couple of _“Oh, that’s cool!”_ moments.

Of course, HTTP headers alone are not very useful if your API doesn’t do anything with them. As with everything in HTTP, the power lies in the implementation. Luckily enough, there are a lot of libraries for Rails that will allow us to accomplish some useful tasks through HTTP headers: stuff like pagination, authentication and more. A good rule of thumb is that, if something is not part of the entity you’re attaching to your request (or response), it probably belongs in the headers of that request (or response). Use them fiercely but carefully; you’ll be fine.

## Status Codes

Just like with headers, it’s rare for a developer to think about the most appropriate HTTP status code to respond with. We think the framework takes care of it, but it doesn’t: even though it fully supports the entire range of HTTP status codes, Rails does not have any magic to determine the right status code to respond with. This means the responsibility of using the right status codes falls on us.

### What Does the Rails Say?

In the above paragraph, I said that Rails is dumb when it comes to determining the right status code for a response. Actually, the framework _does_ use appropriate status codes in a limited set of situations. Knowing what Rails does in our place can help us write less code, so here’s a list of default behaviors:

- for successful requests, Rails will respond with `200 OK` unless told otherwise;
- when a `.find` or `.find_by!` call fails, Rails will respond with `404 Not Found`;
- when `[ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique](http://www.rubydoc.info/docs/rails/4.1.7/ActiveRecord/RecordNotUnique)` is raised, Rails will respond with `409 Conflict`;
- when the app crashes, Rails will respond with `500 Internal Server Error`.

As you can imagine, these four cases only cover a very tiny fraction of the situations that can arise in an API. We’ll have to handle the rest of them ourselves.

_(Yes, the title of this paragraph is a tribute to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE).)_

As you probably know, HTTP status codes are split into 5 different classes, each identified by the first digit of the status code. Here’s a list of them with a description of what each one means:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qMwAuKRXaM4Sv6TQQ7FK7Q.png)

Again, you can find the full list of status codes [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes). Since not all of them are useful in the context of a (simple) RESTful API, I have prepared another table with the most useful ones. We’re not going to use all of them, as some are a bit specific (e.g. `402 Payment Required`), but it’s good to know about them.

### What’s in a Reason Phrase?

If an HTTP status code can already be uniquely identified by its number, what are the reason phrases for? Aren’t they redundant?

The answer is yes. Reason phrases are not meant for HTTP clients to understand the status code, but rather to make it more comprehensible by humans when they have to read it directly. So, instead of `200 OK` you could just as easily respond with `200 Done`, or `200 Not Found` or even just `200` and (compliant) HTTP clients would still interpret it correctly.

In fact, HTTP/1.1 lists reason phrases as optional (strictly speaking, a space would still be required after the number, but we can reasonably expect HTTP clients to work just as fine without it), while [HTTP/2 drops them completely](https://http2.github.io/http2-spec/#rfc.section.8.1.2.4).

Of course, we’re going to use the phrases suggested by the HTTP specification, as inventing new ones would be useless and confusing.

Clients will use status codes to inform their users about the result of an operation and, possibly, to determine what behavior to adopt after the operation has completed. For this reason, learning to use the right status code at the right time is key to developing a functional RESTful API. It’s not magic: a little practice is all you’ll need.
