# Logophobia

Some of you might know I’m a huge fan of George Carlin. Not only I find his rants exhilarating, I also think there’s a great deal of wisdom in (most of) them. [One of George’s biggest complaints](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuEQixrBKCc) regarded the weakening of our language by means of euphemisms and politically correct speech.

Let me tell you, people, there’s no need to refer to cripples as “the physically challenged” or “the differently abled”. They’re cripples. Calling them cripples doesn’t diminish them. It’s not offensive and it’s not untasteful, it’s not insensitive. In fact, if I were a cripple, I’d probably be pissed off whenever someone called me “physically challenged”. A five-foot-two guy trying to fuck a horse is physically challenged. I’d like not to be confused with such a character. (By the way, I’m all in favor of free love, but sheep is usually where I draw the line.)

In the same spirit, retarded people are not “intellectually challenged”. Me trying to solve a septic equation with twenty eight unknowns is intellectually challenged. Retarded people are just that — retarded. There’s a reason we chose that word in the first place: it’s simple, it tells the story. I mean, the real story, not the one politically correct white collars hypocrites want you to believe. Retarded people tend to have a harder time grasping simple concepts than everybody else. If you don’t like “retarded”, how about “slow”? I really enjoy it. It’s not as incisive, it has a weaker sound to it, but it’s still as meaningful. Why anybody would consciously choose to use “mentally impaired” or “intellectually disabled” when there are more honest alternatives eludes me.

With this said, I don’t understand (perhaps I’m a bit of a retard myself) why, whenever the word “retarded” is used to describe a stupid thing or person, the author of the aforementioned observation has to get an umbrella and swiftly take cover from [all the shit raining on him](http://eev.ee/blog/2014/08/06/maybe-youre-just-not-very-funny/) (or her — I like some equality in my meditations).

One might argue that it’s offensive because you’re implying that mental retardation is negative. Well, here’s a question for you, folks: If someone offered to make you retarded (to… retard you?) by hitting you repeatedly over the head with an iron bar, what would you say? I know that it might actually be an improvement for some of you, but let’s suppose you’re in the beautiful land of normal people, just for the sake of argument. I bet you’re not giving the answer much thought. If you are, it’s possible you’re already halfway to Moron City.

Of course being retarded is bad, you bunch of idiots! How would you like not being able to locate your own asshole? It’s a defect and a fucking serious one, too. These people are not normal — not by our standards, at least. They might be beautiful, caring folks, they might be fun to be around, but please, don’t insist in stating they’re _just like the rest of us._

First of all, the fact alone that you’re saying they’re like us implies that anything different from us is bad. Quite arrogant, don’t you think? It’s the same sort of bullshit you’re trying to avoid in the first place.

Secondly, saying they’re like us is just plain fucking stupid, because they’re obviously not. This doesn’t mean they should be marginalized — it’s that I refuse to be put in a category I don’t belong to: just like I wouldn’t say homosexuals are “just like me”, I wouldn’t say retards are. You can scream the contrary all you want, but it won’t change a single thing.

I’m not retarded, I’m smarter.

I’m not black, I’m whiter.

I’m not Irish, I’m darker. And Italian-er.

And so on and so forth.

Then there’s another bunch of logophobic motherfuckers who simply refuse to call retards anything at all, in light of some twisted moral principle they pulled out of their ass that “people shouldn’t have labels put on them.” I can’t even begin to express how pointless, idiotic and harmful that is. You _do_ understand that labeling people is the only way for communication (and perhaps the human species) to survive, right? And don’t even get started about discrimination, because this has nothing to do with discriminating people. I’m just talking about observing reality and reporting it honestly. The whole purpose of language is to fucking identify stuff, and to identify it is to… guess what? That’s right, to label it!

I think that people should start calling things by their names. Murdering the language used to describe an issue will not make the issue disappear — actually, it will worsen it. After all, “mentally impaired” doesn’t sound as bad as “retarded”, does it? If we had retards, perhaps we’d have to do something. Thank God mentally impaired is all our people are.

Refusing to say the retarded are retarded is retarded. End of story.
