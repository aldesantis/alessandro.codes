If you’re a Dune fan, you’ll probably be familiar with the Bene Gesserit’s [agony box.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y4PMUD2KjY&ab_channel=4KHDRMedia) If you’re not, here’s a primer: early in the story, a young Paul Atreides is forced to choose between death or sticking his hand into a mysterious box—a box which, as he quickly discovers, causes excruciating pain, but will at least allow him to live. It’s a powerful scene, and one of those rare cases in which the movie lives up to the book.

**I also think it’s an effective metaphor for how AI has been shaping the retail and e-commerce industries.** Let me explain.

In just a few years, cultural and technological shifts have made our world much too opaque and fragmented for our mortal brains to understand and shape effectively. This was caused by a number of factors: the signal loss that resulted from Apple’s ITP and ATT (and soon, from Google’s Privacy Sandbox); the post-COVID resurgence of omnichannel shopping; and [the increased fragmentation of the cultural landscape.](https://quick.study/soloculture-1)

In response, we’re giving more and more control to machine learning models which, by their very nature, operate as black boxes. No one knows how Facebook’s Advantage+ Shopping Campaigns or Google’s PMax work _exactly_: in a parareligious interaction, you sacrifice your advertising budget on Meta’s altar and pray that the Algorithm Gods will give you a favorable quarter. And _it actually works_—most of the time, at least.

**AI is eating the world, and for a good reason:** it is now necessary to make sense of and imprint ourselves onto an increasingly messy world. Much like Paul Atreides sticking his hand in the box because the alternative is a horrible death, we’re giving away our agency to technologies we don’t understand in order to escape the complexity that threatens to swallow us.

But once the marginal cost of creation drops to zero, **how does that change the meaning of brands, and how does it affect the people who consume them?**

---

Let’s start with the good: far and wide, AI is enabling operators to focus on what truly matters. With the latest versions of ASC and PMax, marketers can increasingly focus on making great creative that breaks through the noise and leave machines to figure out the rest.

In this sense, AI is a tool that strips out the unnecessary—the targeting, the tuning, the micro-optimization—and allows us to do what we do best—creative and strategic thinking.

And yet, at the same time, **AI is enabling us to put an unprecedented amount of useless crap into the world.** We are already witnessing a deluge of algorithmically generated [books](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-imminent-enshittification-of) and [product descriptions.](https://futurism.com/amazon-products-ai-generated) Give it a couple of years, and there will be very little stopping us from generating entire brands with AI—in fact, [some of us are already doing it.](https://pod.link/679570743/episode/e8651b892fd7774b04aabffbd7e3db6b)

**When barriers to entry are lowered in an industry, the long-term effect is an increase in innovation velocity and the redistribution of wealth. The short-term effect is often a decrease in the industry’s signal-to-noise ratio.**

This is the same thing that happened when Shopify “armed the rebels,” allowing anyone with an Internet connection and some spare change to launch their online store. On the upside, it enabled a new generation of brands to enter the scene—brands that _needed_ the Shopify ecosystem to blossom. On the downside, it gave birth to thousands of [glorified dropshipping operations](https://nebulab.com/newsletter/maslow-and-brands).

**Just like Shopify before it, I fear AI might also lead to a sea of sameness,** a constellation of brands all born out of the same trite prompts, deployed mindlessly by wannabe entrepreneurs who missed the golden years of cheap DTC arbitrage and think they can still get in on the action. Not the kind of prospect that makes me excited to get out of bed in the morning.

Furthermore, it’s becoming increasingly clear that AI is the technology we needed to achieve hyper-personalization.

Advantage+ and PMax are not just optimizing campaign audiences: they can now also optimize _the creative._ Platforms like [FERMÀT](https://www.fermatcommerce.com/) allow operators to create landing pages, PDPs, and carts to match their ads and then optimize them automatically through—you guessed it—AI. Every marketing, retention, and merchandising solution on Earth now boasts about its ML algorithm.

Fast-forward five years, and what you get is every founder’s, marketer’s, and merchandiser’s dream. It’s TikTok’s For You page applied not just to your creative, or your audience, or your PLPs, but to every aspect of your brand—the product, the customer experience, the communication, perhaps even the branding itself.

The smart folks at Future Commerce have long been talking about [how the brand of the future will be multiplayer](https://visions.futurecommerce.com/product/the-multiplayer-brand)—shaped by the taste, belief, and sensitivities of its customer base, not of its creators.

Today, I’m challenging that prediction: **far from being a collective artifact, the brand of the future will be remixed and reshaped to appease you and you only.** It will be dynamic, 1:1, and real-time—all the time.

To be clear, I have no doubt this will have good implications for both brands and consumers. There’s ample evidence that personalization leads to increased engagement, conversion rates, and basket sizes, and any technology that helps brands be more relevant gets my vote.

**But where do we draw the line, if a line exists at all?**

[![](https://mcusercontent.com/679f4835b2683d59bc5762ec3/images/9619a0e0-1581-061d-b95f-6865aa6781b2.png)](https://www.fermatcommerce.com/)

In the past, brands would choose an audience and a point of view and stick to them—not out of virtue, but because they needed to strike a balance between niching down (which offers relevance) and broadening out (which offers scale). In doing so, they sent a message: this is what we stand for. For the best brands, that message became part of the cultural discourse.

AI might allow us to do both: reach virtually everyone, but still do it in a way that’s highly relevant to every single individual. In a world where that’s possible, boundaries may need to be set artificially. We’ll be this, but we won’t be that. We’ll go here, but we won’t go there. And because it will be a wholly arbitrary exercise, it will also require much more discipline than before.

Alternatively, we’re headed for a bleak future: much like Schrödinger’s cat, which is both alive and dead until you open the box, **brands will be nothing and everything—that is, until the very moment you look at them.**
