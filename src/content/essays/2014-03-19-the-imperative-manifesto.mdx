A few months ago I read somewhere that it’s important to have a personal manifesto, so that you never forget who you are. Personally, I think it’d be quite hard to forget who I am, but the idea was fun so I did it anyway. This is what I came up with.

# 1. Understand Complexity

> “The complexity of things — the things within things — just seems to be endless. I mean nothing is easy, nothing is simple.” (Alice Munro)

I _will not_ think my journey has ended.

I _will_ strive to understand.

I _will_ acknowledge reality is complex.

# 2. Overcome Failure

> “Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius _will not_; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated failures. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.” (Calvin Coolidge)

I _will not_ let failure put me down.

I _will_ learn from my mistakes.

I _will_ seek experience, not glory.

# 3. Embrace Diversity

> “Armageddon is not around the corner. This is only what the people of violence want us to believe. The complexity and diversity of the world is the hope for the future.” (Michael Palin)

I _will_ defend my ideas.

I _will_ be the master and the learner.

I _will not_ be afraid of diversity.

# 4. Make a Difference

> “You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and achievement. You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you forget the errand.” (Woodrow Wilson)

I _will not_ create what is not needed.

I _will_ improve what already exists.

I _will_ use my talents to better the world.

# **5\. Enjoy Yourself**

> “Time you enjoy wasting, was not wasted.” (John Lennon)

I _will not_ do something I dislike.

I _will not_ take anything too seriously.

I _will not_ misspend my time.
