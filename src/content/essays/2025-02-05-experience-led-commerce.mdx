## Audience

CEOs, CMOs, CTOs, CDOs and equivalent (VPs, Directors, Heads) at upper-midmarket/enterprise brands ($50-500M in yearly GMV) that sell through a DTC e-commerce store.

## Thesis

Customer Experience is not just a cost center but a strategic lever to increase revenue and profits and minimize operating cost.

## Research

### Marketplaces vs. DTC sites

- **Marketplaces** accounted for **67% of global e-commerce sales volume**, with Amazon, eBay, and Walmart leading as primary platforms[8](https://www.modernretail.co/technology/modern-retail-research-as-dtc-dominates-marketplaces-edge-out-retailer-channels-for-brand-investment/)[13](https://www.statista.com/topics/8838/d2c-e-commerce/).
- **DTC sites** ranked as the **third-most popular online purchase channel** (after marketplaces and retail e-commerce sites), generating $135B in U.S. sales for established brands[13](https://www.statista.com/topics/8838/d2c-e-commerce/)[16](https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2023/12/20/e-commerce-trends-2024/).

#### 2024 Trends and Growth

1. **Marketplaces accelerated adoption**:
	- 41% of shoppers increased their use of retail e-commerce sites and marketplaces compared to 2023[5](https://www.retaildive.com/press-release/20241015-73-of-consumers-are-moving-their-shopping-more-online-in-2024-1worldsync/).
	- Amazon remained a dominant force, with 39% of merchants prioritizing it as a growth channel[1](https://myfbaprep.com/blog/conversions/ecommerce-statistics/)[8](https://www.modernretail.co/technology/modern-retail-research-as-dtc-dominates-marketplaces-edge-out-retailer-channels-for-brand-investment/).
	- Social commerce platforms like TikTok Shop gained traction, contributing to marketplace expansion[3](https://www.adquadrant.com/2024-dtc-ecommerce-trends-to-watch/)[5](https://www.retaildive.com/press-release/20241015-73-of-consumers-are-moving-their-shopping-more-online-in-2024-1worldsync/).
2. **DTC growth faced headwinds**:
	- Only 15% of consumers reported browsing DTC sites more frequently in 2024, while 21% used them less[5](https://www.retaildive.com/press-release/20241015-73-of-consumers-are-moving-their-shopping-more-online-in-2024-1worldsync/).
	- U.S. DTC sales were projected to reach $161B in 2024 (up from $135B in 2023), but this growth lagged behind marketplace-driven revenue[12](https://www.shopify.com/no/enterprise/blog/direct-to-consumer)[13](https://www.statista.com/topics/8838/d2c-e-commerce/).

#### Key Drivers

- **Marketplace advantages**: Wider product selection, competitive pricing, and streamlined logistics drove consumer preference[5](https://www.retaildive.com/press-release/20241015-73-of-consumers-are-moving-their-shopping-more-online-in-2024-1worldsync/)[19](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1274958/motivating-factors-for-purchasing-d2c-sites-worldwide/).
- **DTC challenges**: Brands struggled with rising customer acquisition costs and competition from marketplaces, though hyper-personalization and sustainability efforts helped retain niche audiences[3](https://www.adquadrant.com/2024-dtc-ecommerce-trends-to-watch/)[6](https://webandcrafts.com/blog/dtc-ecommerce-trends)[16](https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2023/12/20/e-commerce-trends-2024/).

### Consumer Spending Behavior

- **76% of consumers traded down** across categories in Q3 2024 through strategies like buying smaller sizes or switching retailers[3](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-state-of-the-us-consumer)[4](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-value-now-consumer-making-sense-of-us-consumer-sentiment-and-spending). This rises to 86% among Gen Z and millennials, compared to 76% of Gen X[3](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-state-of-the-us-consumer).
- **53% remain pessimistic** about the economy despite increased aggregate spending, creating a “value now” mindset where purchases must justify their cost[4](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-value-now-consumer-making-sense-of-us-consumer-sentiment-and-spending).
**Generational Spending Divides**
- **90% of millennials** report significant spending impacts from inflation[2](https://www.junglescout.com/resources/reports/consumer-trends-2024-q2/), while **86% of Gen Z** prioritize price comparisons before purchases[3](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-state-of-the-us-consumer).
- Affluent millennials show paradoxical behavior: **27% traded up** in categories like apparel while simultaneously cutting costs elsewhere[3](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-state-of-the-us-consumer).
**Essential vs Discretionary Shifts**
- Non-essential spending grew just **1.9%** in 2024 vs 4.2% in 2023, while essential spending slowed to **0.9% growth**[6](https://home.barclays/news/press-releases/2024/12/barclays-reveals-2024-s-top-10-consumer-spending-trends--as-card/)[9](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/consumer-pulse/state-of-the-us-consumer.html).
- **70% of households** cite inflation’s ongoing impact on grocery budgets, with 58% actively seeking promotions on staples[31](https://www.retaildive.com/spons/adapting-to-consumer-spending-habits-in-2024/730494/).
**Emerging Financial Strategies**
- Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) adoption rose **30%** among social shoppers in 2024[2](https://www.junglescout.com/resources/reports/consumer-trends-2024-q2/), though growth slowed to **0.4% monthly** by early 2025 as even high-income households ($600K+) became more cautious[8](https://institute.bankofamerica.com/economic-insights/consumer-checkpoint-march-2024.html).
**2025 Spending Intentions**
- **61% of consumers** plan to maintain or reduce overall spending levels in 2025[9](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/consumer-pulse/state-of-the-us-consumer.html), with particular caution around big-ticket items.
- The exception: **40% still intend to splurge** on experiential categories like dining out and travel, primarily among high-income groups[3](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-state-of-the-us-consumer)[23](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nikkibaird/2024/01/11/4-consumer-behavior-questions-that-will-shape-2024/).

### McKinsey’s Experience-Led Growth

URL: https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/experience-led-growth-a-new-way-to-create-value

Key Statistics:

- Compensating for one lost customer requires acquiring three new customers
- 80% of value creation by the world’s most successful growth companies comes from their core business
- Companies that get growth right deliver 30% higher TRS (total return to shareholders) and nearly double the shareholder value compared to industry peers
- CX leaders achieved more than double the revenue growth of “CX laggards” between 2016-2021

Benefits of Successful Experience-Led Growth Strategies:

- Increase cross-sell rates by 15-25%
- Boost share of wallet by 5-10%
- Improve customer satisfaction and engagement by 20-30%

Case Study Results:

- Telecom Operator Example:
    - Reduced customer churn rates by 75%
    - Nearly doubled revenues over three years
    - Outstripped competitors’ revenue growth threefold
    - Went from worst to first in industry customer satisfaction ratings

Three Key Pillars for Success:

1. Setting clear growth aspiration and purpose with CX-to-value roadmap
2. Transforming business through redesigned customer journeys, products, services, and business models
3. Enabling transformation through new mindsets, capabilities, technologies, governance, and CX measurement

Recovery Impact:

- Companies that were CX leaders showed faster recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other companies

Time Horizons:

- Companies typically set 3-5 year visions for delivering on their brand promise
- Benefits measured over a ten-year period for shareholder returns (2005-2019, N>5,000 companies)

This research demonstrates that focusing on existing customer experience rather than aggressive customer acquisition can lead to more sustainable, profitable growth for incumbent companies.

### Consumer CX Expectations

Consumers are raising the bar for e-commerce experiences, demanding seamless, personalized, and frictionless interactions at every touchpoint. Here’s a data-driven analysis of evolving expectations and their implications for brands:

#### **Key Drivers of Rising CX Expectations**

#### **Emerging Non-Negotiables for 2025**

|Expectation|Supporting Data|
|---|---|
|**Instant Gratification**|65% abandon carts if delivery takes >1 week[13](https://www.sekologistics.com/en/resource-hub/knowledge-hub/the-evolution-of-customer-expectations-in-ecommerce-and-how-to-meet-them/)[19](https://www.dhl.com/global-en/microsites/supply-chain/fulfillment-network/knowledge-hub/e-commerce-consumer-expectations.html).|

- **Transparency**: Clearly explain data use – 71% of consumers reward this with trust[12](https://getthematic.com/insights/ecommerce-cx-statistics-growth-engine/).
- **Sustainability**: 56% of B2B buyers pay more for eco-friendly practices[11](https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2024/12/04/e-commerce-trends-2025/).

The data unequivocally supports the thesis: consumer expectations for e-commerce CX are escalating rapidly, driven by tech advancements and pandemic-era digital adoption[4](https://www.bloomreach.com/en/blog/ecommerce-customer-experience)[11](https://www.the-future-of-commerce.com/2024/12/04/e-commerce-trends-2025/). Brands that fail to invest in AI-driven personalization, frictionless interfaces, and ethical transparency risk irreversible customer attrition[6](https://lucidworks.com/post/50-customer-experience-trends-2025/)[27](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/e-commerce-expectations-reviews-poor-experiences/711051/). Those prioritizing CX as a core growth engine, however, stand to capture loyalty and outsized revenue gains[3](https://www.salesfire.co.uk/articles/ecommerce-customer-experience/)[6](https://lucidworks.com/post/50-customer-experience-trends-2025/).

# Outline

## Introduction

- The e-commerce landscape is changing:
	- Both CPMs and CACs have risen dramatically over the last years.
	  - Consumer expectations are on the rise:
		  - Consumers are increasingly value-oriented (see “Consumer Spending Behavior”).
	  - So on one hand, acquiring consumers is more expensive; on the other, those acquired consumers are spending less than ever.
		  - This leads to the fact that it’s never been harder to scale a consumer brand profitably.
  - It’s no surprise that the D2C channel is losing ground to marketplaces (see “Marketplaces vs. DTC sites”).
	  - This is a trend pushed forward both by brands, looking for an easier channel to scale, and by consumers, looking for convenience.
	  - The problem with marketplaces is that they promote aggressive price competition, creating a race to the bottom for the brands.
		  - This is a trend we explored in our recent article, [Redefining the Digital Value Chain for Multi-Brand Retail](https://nebulab.com/blog/multi-brand-retail-strategy).
  - All of the above means that brands are stuck between a rock and a hard place.
  - Getting out of this conundrum is no easy feat.
  - However, in our experience there’s at least one strategic lever that brands are not leveraging that could help them extract more value out of their DTC channel, and that’s customer experience.
  - Let’s see how etc.

## Treating Customer Experience as a Value Driver

- Historically, most brands have treated CX as a cost center, i.e., a minimum bar you must meet to be competitive.
- Furthermore, the battle for good CX is getting fiercer, with consumers having increasingly high standards when it comes to CX:
	- Quote data and sources from “Consumer CX Expectations”.
- Players like Shopify have commoditized CX, making it easier for smaller brands to compete. At the same time, however, they’ve also led to a sort of “complacency,” with brands settling for the bare minimum without thinking about how they can innovate.
- It’s a pity because there are signs that CX can be much more than a cost center and become a revenue and profit driver:	-
	- Quote data from “McKinsey’s Experience-Led Growth”.

## Going from Thought to Action

- Brands struggle to translate their CX ambitions into actionable initiatives that drive measurable results
- In the next article, we’ll talk about how to do exactly that

# Experience-Led Commerce: Turning Customer Experience Into Your Next DTC Growth Engine

The battle for e-commerce growth has never been more challenging. As brands navigate an increasingly complex digital landscape, they’re caught in a perfect storm of rising costs and shifting consumer behaviors that’s fundamentally reshaping the economics of direct-to-consumer (DTC) business.

The data paints a clear picture: [marketplaces now command 67% of global e-commerce sales volume](https://www.modernretail.co/technology/modern-retail-research-as-dtc-dominates-marketplaces-edge-out-retailer-channels-for-brand-investment/), while DTC engagement continues to decline. [Only 15% of consumers reported browsing DTC sites more frequently in 2024, with 21% actually reducing their usage](https://www.retaildive.com/press-release/20241015-73-of-consumers-are-moving-their-shopping-more-online-in-2024-1worldsync/). This isn’t merely a temporary trend—it reflects a fundamental shift in how consumers approach online shopping.

Two critical factors are driving this transformation. First, customer acquisition costs have risen dramatically, driven by increased competition and evolving privacy regulations. Second, consumer spending patterns have fundamentally changed—[76% of consumers actively traded down across categories in Q3 2024, with this behavior even more pronounced among younger generations, where 86% of Gen Z and millennials report making such adjustments](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-state-of-the-us-consumer).

The economic context makes this particularly challenging. [Despite increased aggregate spending, 53% of consumers remain pessimistic about the economy, creating a "value now" mindset where every purchase must thoroughly justify its cost](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/the-value-now-consumer-making-sense-of-us-consumer-sentiment-and-spending). Looking ahead, [61% of consumers plan to maintain or reduce their overall spending levels in 2025](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/consumer-pulse/state-of-the-us-consumer.html).

## Navigating the New DTC Economics

This environment has created a strategic dilemma for DTC brands. The traditional growth playbook—centered around aggressive customer acquisition and premium pricing—is becoming increasingly unsustainable. While many brands are responding by shifting focus to marketplaces for easier scale and broader reach, this approach creates its own challenges: marketplaces inherently promote price-based competition, creating a race to the bottom that erodes brand value and profit margins. This is a trend we also explored in our recent article, [Redefining the Digital Value Chain for Multi-Brand Retail](https://nebulab.com/blog/multi-brand-retail-strategy).

However, our experience working with mid-market and enterprise brands suggests there’s an underutilized lever that could help companies break free from this conundrum: customer experience (CX). When leveraged correctly, we’ve observed that customer experience can be transformed into a powerful engine for sustainable growth.

In this series of articles, we’ll explore how brands can elevate customer experience from a basic operational requirement to a strategic differentiator that drives both top-line growth and bottom-line profitability.

## Promoting Customer Experience to Value Driver

For too long, brands have viewed customer experience primarily as a cost center–a necessary investment to meet basic competitive standards. This perspective, while common, overlooks the tremendous potential of CX as a strategic growth driver. The evidence for this missed opportunity is compelling, both in terms of rising consumer expectations and documented business impact.

Today’s consumers have radically higher expectations for their digital shopping experiences. [80% of customers now consider the digital experience to be just as important as the product itself](https://lucidworks.com/post/50-customer-experience-trends-2025/), marking a fundamental shift in how value is perceived in e-commerce. These expectations manifest across multiple dimensions:

- **Personalization has become non-negotiable**: [60% of consumers become repeat buyers when offered tailored experiences](https://www.salesfire.co.uk/articles/ecommerce-customer-experience/), while 42% express frustration with generic content. Despite this clear preference, [only 14% of consumers report fully personalized online experiences](https://www.bloomreach.com/en/blog/ecommerce-customer-experience), highlighting a significant opportunity gap.
- **The cost of poor experiences has skyrocketed**: [80% of shoppers abandon purchases due to poor navigation, slow load times, or unclear product information](https://www.bloomreach.com/en/blog/ecommerce-customer-experience). Even more concerning, [41% permanently abandon brands after a single false decline](https://www.agilitypr.com/pr-news/public-relations/the-state-of-consumer-attitudes-on-ecommerce-fraud-and-cx-in-2023/) (fraud rejection).
- **Speed and convenience set new benchmarks**: [65% of consumers abandon their carts if delivery takes more than a week](https://www.sekologistics.com/en/resource-hub/knowledge-hub/the-evolution-of-customer-expectations-in-ecommerce-and-how-to-meet-them/), demonstrating how operational excellence has become inextricably linked with customer experience.

The democratization of e-commerce technology, led by platforms like Shopify, has created an interesting paradox. While these platforms have made it easier for brands to deliver competent customer experiences, they’ve also led to a form of complacency. Many brands settle for the default experience provided by their platform, viewing it as “good enough” rather than a potential source of competitive advantage.

This standardization of basic CX capabilities has raised the floor but lowered the ceiling of innovation. [77% of companies now view CX as a key competitive differentiator](https://www.salesfire.co.uk/articles/ecommerce-customer-experience/), yet few are pushing beyond the templated experiences offered by their platforms.

This is quite unfortunate, because recent research from McKinsey provides compelling evidence that savvy brands can transform customer experience from a cost center into a powerful growth engine. The numbers are striking:

- [Compensating for one lost customer requires acquiring three new customers](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/experience-led-growth-a-new-way-to-create-value), highlighting the multiplicative effect of customer experience on acquisition costs.
- Companies that excel at customer experience achieved [more than double the revenue growth of "CX laggards" between 2016-2021](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/experience-led-growth-a-new-way-to-create-value).
- [Companies that get growth right deliver 30% higher total return to shareholders](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/experience-led-growth-a-new-way-to-create-value) and nearly double the shareholder value compared to industry peers.

Hopefully, the business case for treating customer experience as a value driver is clear and compelling. Yet many brands struggle to translate this opportunity into actionable strategies that deliver measurable results.

## Deploying CX Strategically through Experience-Led Commerce

Based on our work with mid-market and enterprise brands at Nebulab, and inspired by McKinsey’s research on Experience-Led Growth (XLG), we’ve been experimenting with an innovative approach we call “Experience-Led Commerce” (XLC). This framework treats customer experience not as a standalone function but as a systematic process for driving growth and profitability.

XLC differs from traditional growth strategies in several key ways:

1. It’s not a replacement for marketing-based growth but rather an amplifier, helping brands maximize their marketing ROI by increasing customer lifetime value and reducing acquisition costs.
2. It decouples value creation from product and pricing alone, providing a path to differentiation that allows brands to create incremental profit.
3. It creates a virtuous cycle where improved experiences lead to higher customer retention, which in turn fosters organic customer acquisition and reduces the pressure created by acquisition costs.

McKinsey’s research on companies that successfully implement experience-led approaches demonstrates the potential impact of this strategy. [Their data](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/experience-led-growth-a-new-way-to-create-value) shows that such companies can achieve:

- a 15-25% increase in cross-sell rates,
- a 5-10% boost in customer wallet share, and
- 20-30% improvement in satisfaction and engagement metrics.

For those willing to make the investment, the rewards can be transformative: all else being equal, brands with superior CX outperform their peers across all key performance indicators, creating a compelling case for treating customer experience not as a cost to be minimized but as a strategic business investment.

### Going From Idea to Action

While the case for investing in customer experience is clear, many brands find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer number of opportunities for improvement. From personalization to omnichannel integration, from self-service capabilities to loyalty programs, the possibilities can seem endless. Without a systematic approach to evaluating and prioritizing these opportunities, brands risk pursuing initiatives that deliver suboptimal returns or dilute their core value proposition.

Experience-Led Commerce solves precisely that problem: it helps brands cut through this complexity by providing a structured framework for identifying, evaluating, and executing customer experience initiatives that drive measurable business results.

In our next article, we’ll take a deep dive into the XLC framework, exploring its key components and showing you how to put it into practice in your organization.
