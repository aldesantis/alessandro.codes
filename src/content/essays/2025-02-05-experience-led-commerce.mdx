  Experience-Led Commerce: Turning Customer Experience Into Your New Growth
  Engine
---
- The e-commerce landscape is changing:
	- Cost of advertising is on the rise:
		- Find statistics about CPM/CPA increases over the last 5 years
		- It’s never been harder to scale a consumer brand profitably
	  - Consumer expectations are on the rise:
		  - Consumers are increasingly value-oriented:
			  - Quote BoF article about consumers wanting brand to prove their value
	  - Brands are expected to do more with less
  - Because of the above, the D2C channel is losing ground to marketplaces:
	  - Find stats to quote: what % of purchases happened on marketplaces in 2024 compared to 2023?
	  - The problem with marketplaces is that they are a giant price comparison machine, forcing all brands into a race to the bottom.
- Is there a third way out of this conundrum?

## Treating Customer Experience as a Value Driver

- Historically, most brands have treated CX as a cost center, i.e., a minimum bar you must meet to be competitive.
- Furthermore, the battle for good CX is getting fiercer, with consumers having increasingly high standards when it comes to CX:
	- Quote data from Shopify’s “State of Commerce” report.
- Players like Shopify have commoditized CX, making it easier for smaller brands to compete. At the same time, however, they’ve also led to a sort of “complacency,” with brands settling for the bare minimum without thinking about how they can innovate.
- It’s a pity because there are signs that CX can be much more than a cost center and become a revenue and profit driver:	-
	- Quote stats from McKinsey study about Experience-Led Growth.
- In our work at Nebulab, we’ve seen first hand how CX can help brands stand out. We’ve begun to call this approach “Experience-Led Commerce” (XLC).
	- Experience-Led Commerce is a systemic and systematic process that brands can adopt to leverage CX to increase revenue and profit, minimize operational costs, or more generally achieve their objectives.
	- XLC does NOT replace performance marketing activities but rather amplifies their impact by helping brands maximize their marketing ROI.
	- XLC can help brands maximize the ROI of their marketing activities.
	- Furthermore, XLC helps brands decouple their value proposition from their product and pricing, allowing them to eschew the race to the bottom ignited by price comparison.
- Caveat that it’s not a panacea: it requires novel skills and significant discipline and resources. However, when done right, it leads to stickier and more durable brands.

## The Five Dimensions of Customer Experience

- You can think about CX across five dimensions:
	- Who:
		- Brand
		- Operator
		- Consumer
	- When:
		- There are six phases to the customer journey:
			- Discovery
			- Consideration
			- Purchase
			- Fulfillment
			- Post-Purchase
			- Retention
		- In turn, each one of these phases is comprised of several touchpoints, which can be:
			- Customer-initiated:
				- Discovery: Using search, asking questions, requesting info
				- Consideration: Reading reviews, comparing products, seeking size advice
				- Purchase: Adding to cart, checkout, resolving payment issues
				- Post-Purchase: Writing reviews, initiating returns, requesting support
				- Retention: Joining loyalty program, sharing referrals, reporting issues
			- Brand-initiated:
				- Discovery: Retargeting ads, welcome emails, promotional content
				- Consideration: Abandoned cart reminders, live chat popups
				- Purchase: Product recommendations, order confirmations
				- Post-Purchase: Shipping updates, feedback requests
				- Retention: Loyalty communications, personalized offers
	- Where (i.e., sales channel):
		- Digital (web, mobile, app, social commerce)
		- Physical (stores, pop-ups, showrooms)
	- Why (i.e., motivations and goals to pursue):
		- Economic Whys (Rational/Financial)
			- Consumer: Value, savings, financial optimization
			- Brand: Growth, profitability, market share
			- Operator: Efficiency, productivity, resource optimization
		- Functional Whys (Practical/Operational)
			- Consumer: Problem-solving, convenience, utility
			- Brand: Product-market fit, operational excellence
			- Operator: Process efficiency, service delivery
		- Aspirational Whys (Identity/Values)
			- Consumer: Self-expression and status, Community belonging, Personal values (sustainability, innovation, ethics)
			- Brand: Brand positioning and differentiation, Community building, Purpose and impact
			- Operator: Professional growth, Team culture, Mission alignment
	- How (i.e., what medium the CX is expressed through):
		- Business (pricing strategy, return policy, loyalty programs, value-added services, value proposition, etc.)
		- Design (branding, UX/UI, visual language, copy, etc.)
		- Technology (infrastructure, platform, tools, etc.)
- You need to understand your CX well across all five dimensions.
- Over time, you need to work on and build synergies across all five dimensions so they’re all perfectly aligned and deliver the same brand message/value prop.
- How to do that exactly? (Leads to the next paragraph.)
