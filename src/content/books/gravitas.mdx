## Highlights

- Gravitas requires the same balance of forces. The weight of your seriousness must always be balanced equally by your ability to lighten up – humour, humility and wit.

- Knowledge + purpose + passion (– anxiety) = Gravitas
- The gravitas equation has deep roots, which go all the way back to Aristotle’s three pillars of logos, ethos and pathos.1
- When it comes to the maxim ‘Know thyself’, that first principle of gravitas, the knowledge must be in the body just as much as in the mind. People with gravitas are present to their physicality as much as to their thinking. It gives them awareness, empathy and speed of response. When you are really present to your body, people start talking about presence.
