## Highlights

- Sometimes, though, people want to know more about your offer before they buy. This is common for businesses that sell more expensive stuff. If that’s you, then you’ll often get more leads to engage by advertising with a lead magnet first.
- People like to consume things in different ways. Some people like watching, other people like reading, others like listening, etc. Make your solution in as many different formats as you can: images, video, text, audio, etc. Offer them all.

- 99% of people aren’t gonna buy, but they will create (or destroy) your reputation based on the value of your free stuff.  So, make your lead magnets as good as your paid stuff. Your reputation depends on it. Provide value. Stack the deck. Reap the rewards.
- This gives you ethical scarcity. If you can’t handle more than five new customers per week, say so. Draw attention to the natural scarcity in your business. If you have limitations you may as well use them to make money.
- the content you create isn’t the compounding asset - the audience is. So even though the content may disappear in time, your audience keeps growing.
- when I put out ten times the content, my audience grew ten times as fast. Volume works. Content works. A growing audience is the result.
- Switch from “How to” to “How I.” From “This is the best way” to “These are my favorite ways” etc. (especially when starting out). Talk about what you’ve done, not what others should do. What you like, not this is the best. When you talk about experience, no one can question you. This makes you bulletproof.
- We Need To Be Reminded More Than We Need To Be Taught: You’re a silly goose if you think 100 percent of your audience listens 100 percent of the time.
- Avoid Pre-Scheduling Posts. The posts I manually post perform better than ones I pre-schedule. Here’s my theory. When you manually post, you know that within seconds you will be rewarded or punished for the quality of the content. Because of that close feedback loop, you try _that much harder_ to make it better.
