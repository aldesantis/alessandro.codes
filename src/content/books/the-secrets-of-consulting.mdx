## Highlights

- My definition of consulting is the art of influencing people at their request.
- Being called a consultant doesn’t make you a consultant, either. Many people are called consultants as a way of glorifying their dull jobs.
- By asking for the consultant’s help, the client is saying, sometimes nonverbally, “I need you. I can’t say so directly, so find a way to help me without destroying my sense of worth.” The wise consultant answers in a way that recognizes the client’s self-worth, but also doesn’t compromise his own.
- The First Law of Consulting: In spite of what your client may tell you, there’s always a problem.
- The Second Law of Consulting: No matter how it looks at first, it’s always a people problem.
- The Third Law of Consulting: Never forget they’re paying you by the hour, not by the solution.
- Once you eliminate your number one problem, number two gets a promotion.
- Most people—that is, most groups of people—function quite logically most of the time. And most of the time they don’t need consultants. The time they do need a consultant is when logic isn’t working.
- Consultants are less adapted to the present situation, and therefore are potentially more adaptable. Their perception of now/then trade-offs is different from those close to the problem, which makes them a valuable source of ideas, as well as people not to be trusted.
- The toughest problems don’t come in neatly labeled packages. Or they come in packages with the wrong labels.
- Repeatedly curing a system that can cure itself will eventually create a system that can’t.***
- Make sure they pay you enough so they’ll do what you say. Another way to state this is The most important act in consulting is setting the right fee.
- The purpose of consulting is not to make me look smart, but it’s not to make me look dumb either.
- Most people instinctively apply The Inverse Gilded Rule to their consultants. If they catch you lying, they’ll figure out that you must have something to hide. Even if it merely sounds like you’re lying, you’re in trouble. We consultants ought to bend over backward to understate our qualifications, but insecurity makes us all victim to occasional exaggeration.
- Find out what you usually miss and design a tool to ensure that you don’t miss it again.
- If we can find other subcultures, we can use them as models to be compared with the culture under investigation.
- Over the years since that lesson, I’ve learned that the ability to sense incongruence is the consultant’s most powerful “What’s missing?” tool. I call this The Incongruence Insight: When words and music don’t go together, they point to a missing element.
- The music you hear from the client is only the external sound of an internal emotional state that you cannot, of course, know directly.
- Words are often useful, but it always pays to listen to the music (especially your own internal music).
- Which brings us full circle, back to knowing yourself, which is where all good consulting work originates.
- What you don’t know may not hurt you, but what you don’t remember always does.
- All the members need the same trigger, but at different times. So, if your entire client organization is comfortably cruising on one Titanic voyage to nowhere, it’s going to take someone from outside to shout “Iceberg!” And then, of course, your clients will say to the outsider, “What do you know about ocean liners?”
- Some outside agents enter organizations as part of the natural order of business. New workers can serve this role. So can new managers. Sometimes, a consultant working on one problem can accidentally touch another area in which the organization is unknowingly stuck.
- As a jiggler, my job is to get something started, to cause some changes that will ultimately get the system unstuck.
- For the professional jiggler, there is always one more question: Could the organization itself have generated the other questions? In other words, could it have jiggled itself?
- I’m seldom retained as a jiggler. Sometimes I’m engaged as a speaker, sometimes to perform a checkup, and other times as a consultant on a technical problem. But there are always opportunities to jiggle.
- Each person sees a part of the whole and identifies the whole with that part. Often, my biggest job is getting the client to accept that other views are possible.
- Before people can communicate effectively through words, they must have shared experiences.
- When consulting, I usually try to take a tour of the entire organization and, if possible, I get a person from one division to escort me to the next. Often, the escort remarks that the incidental trip to another division was the most significant part of my visit.
- If your clients want help in solving problems, you are able to say no. If you say yes but fail, you can live with that. If you succeed, the least satisfying approach is when you solve the problem for them. More satisfying is to help them solve their problems in such a way that they will be more likely to solve the next problem without help.
- Your ideal form of influence is first to help people see their world more clearly, and then to let them decide what to do next.
- Your primary tool is merely being the person you are, so your most powerful method of helping other people is to help yourself.
- A small system that tries to change a big system through long and continued contact is more likely to be changed itself.
- Consultants seeking to preserve quality should first verify that the people responsible for quality are, in fact, downstream from that quality.
- Consultants are downstream from nobody. This gives them a difficult responsibility when instituting change for their clients. Clients realize that consultants are protected from the consequences of their own recommendations, which is one reason consultants are often the butt of nervous jokes.
- Nothing new ever works, but there’s always hope that this time will be different.
- You know no breakthrough ever works, but your clients seem to be suckers for every new fad. Rather than fight change, a more sensible approach is to learn to live with it. Or to make a living from it.
- If you must have something new, take one, not two.
- Whenever my clients struggle in the face of change, I can use that struggle to discover what they value most.
- Most real change is a slow process. Like aging. But when we build illusions to hide the change, we soon find ourselves spending all our energy maintaining the illusions. That keeps us from dealing with change while it’s still small. It’s the crash of illusions that makes us believe change happens as crises.”
- When you create an illusion, to prevent or soften change, the change becomes more likely—and harder to take.
- It’s frightening to encounter a client who doesn’t resist your ideas, because that places the full responsibility on you to be correct at all times. Since nobody’s perfect, we need resistance to test our ideas.
- Resistance is like fungus. It doesn’t thrive in daylight. Therefore, once you suspect that there is resistance, your next step is to get it out in the open, rather than let it fester in the dark.
