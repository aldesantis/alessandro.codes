## Highlights

- the idea that you should be able to make money from your passions is a story that holds too many people back from finding good work.
- Good work doesn’t usually happen on a factory schedule and often has a natural seasonality.
- In Taiwan, I was often uncomfortable and didn’t quite know what was happening around me. But it was a discomfort that made me curious. I wanted to see where it took me.
- Others struggle with feelings of not being productive: when they don’t have a “workday” to show up for, they must reckon with questions like, “Who am I without work?” and “Am I allowed to simply be with myself?”
- This is exactly what good work is about: noticing the season of life you are in, right now, and seeing what work you are called to do.
- As a result, I developed a capacity to make decisions not as a reaction to certain emotions, trying to make them go away, but instead to make decisions together with my emotions, understanding that they would always be with me on my journey.
- Instead of pushing forward, driven by a sense of lack, I’m being pulled by a profound psychological richness that I experience from being in the flow of my own interests.
