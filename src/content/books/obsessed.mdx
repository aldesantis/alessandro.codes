## Highlights

- The brand starts to function as a sort of connective tissue, a real-world hashtag that signals a shared set of values across different groups of people: I see you wearing the same sweatshirt as me, and I see something of myself in you. When people choose which brands to love, they’re choosing which part of themselves they want to convey to the world.
