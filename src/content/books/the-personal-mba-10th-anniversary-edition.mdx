## Highlights

- The existence of a market means you’re already on the right side of the Iron Law of the Market, so you can spend more time developing your offer instead of proving a market exists.
- Your job as a marketer isn’t to convince people to want what you’re offering; it’s to help your prospects convince themselves that what you’re offering will help them get what they want.
