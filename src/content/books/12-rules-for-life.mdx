- “In my kingdom,” as the Red Queen tells Alice in Wonderland, “you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place.” No one standing still can triumph, no matter how well constituted. ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078C6C7QS&location=709))

- To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the terrible responsibility of life, with eyes wide open. ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B078C6C7QS&location=947))
