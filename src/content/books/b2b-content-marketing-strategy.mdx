## Highlights

- “In a time when content saturation is higher than ever before and when nearly 60 percent of all Google searches end without a click, you need to be value-driven. You need to continually win over your audience’s attention. And you do this by posting platform-native content to social media. By optimizing for your content to get seen, not clicked.”
- Content marketing is a strategic growth plan that capitalizes on unique advantages, available resources, and current circumstances to make maximum impact on outcomes using minimal effort.
- a playbook isn’t a strategy. It’s an instruction manual for executing something. There may be principles within, but inherently, and specifically with the B2B content marketing playbook, it’s just a list of activities strung together in a way that was optimized for the state of the internet when it was created.
- Rebrands are primarily useful for creating attention around change: a new strategic direction or product, stale companies trying to reignite or simply capture market share they’ve lost to newer companies entering their space, or changing brand perception if the company has gotten a bad reputation or they have unclear messaging and want to change the minds of a market that has interpreted their value prop due to the company’s own lack of clarity.
- Once this truth sank in, everything changed. If no one truly knows exactly what they’re doing, and there’s no single “correct” way to run a business then I was the perfect person to lead the company, because I had no idea what I was doing!
- Question conventional wisdom with curiosity and don’t judge. You’ll still annoy a lot of people, but they won’t think you’re a jerk, which is important because you’ll need their help when you’re trying to get buy-in.
- Measure what matters, not just what’s easy to track.
- Your first job as a marketer is to identify what you already have that can be leveraged for growth.
- The goal is to create a content strategy that: competitors can’t easily duplicate because they lack your specific advantages; generates exponential impact by leveraging opportunistic events, efficient execution, and activities that serve multiple outcomes simultaneously; is scalable with repeatable elements that compound over time and can expand with relative ease.
- This principle forces you to evaluate each potential marketing activity against a simple standard: Is this the best way to reach the business outcome we want, or are we doing it because it’s the way we’ve always done it?
- A plan is simply a list of activities you know you can accomplish, like running errands in a particular order to minimize time. Strategy, by contrast, is leveraging your resources to produce a desired outcome beyond expectations in some way (such as time, cost, results).
- How do YOUR customers make purchase decisions? What channels do THEY genuinely use for discovery and research? What unique circumstances does YOUR company face?
- I recommend a portfolio-style spread in your marketing activities where the bulk of your resources are directed at activities to cover your objectives but leave some room to try new things.
- Commit to your strategy long enough to properly evaluate it (typically 6–12 months minimum), while maintaining the flexibility to adapt based on what you learn.
- Shift from “anti-AI” to “pro-quality”: Most search engines are moving away from a stance that automatically penalizes AI-generated content. Instead, they are focusing on rewarding high-quality content that meets user needs, regardless of how it’s created.
- Communities need reliable touchpoints and clear expectations. Establish regular rhythms for engagement and stick to them.
- The mistake many companies make is trying to build a community from scratch when they already have the seeds of one waiting to be nurtured.
- Successful communities are built on mutually beneficial value exchange. For your community members, this value might include: access to exclusive expertise or insights connection with peers facing similar challenges recognition for their knowledge and contributions early input into product development professional development opportunities
- building a community that organically facilitates interactions that drive outcomes will intrinsically motivate folks not only to join but also to engage regularly—and of their own accord—because they see the benefit of doing so without your help.
- Active participation in customer communities (both yours and existing professional communities) provides constant learning opportunities. Pay attention to: questions they ask each other resources they share language they use challenges they discuss
- Creating content that genuinely resonates requires vulnerability. It means putting real thoughts and perspectives out there that might be challenged. It’s more comfortable to hide behind generic “thought leadership” than to share authentic perspectives that might not resonate with everyone.
- The most successful B2B companies don’t try to be everywhere. They focus intensely on adding value on the channels where their audience already hangs out and engages naturally.
- Extend reach through partnerships: customer spotlights and case studies industry influencer collaborations participation in podcasts, panels, and other speaking engagements
- My ultimate goal with this chapter is to convince you to get really good at reporting to the point where you enjoy doing it and see it as an opportunity to create leverage for yourself.
- To me, being brave about acquiring knowledge means you’re willing to be out of your depth sometimes in order to obtain it. And that includes admitting you don’t know things to people you’re trying to impress in order to learn it.
- operating with the understanding that whomever you are reporting to has to report to someone else who is at least one giant step removed from your point of view is the most impactful advice I can give you.
- Everything is made up, including reports, so the better you understand the stuff you’re reporting on, the more you can use it to get what YOU want, too!
- “Helpful content gets shared in places that are very hard to track (email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Facebook Groups, etc.), but where there are trusted people who filter the value from the noise. It uplifts the perception of the brand—we remember the helpers. Sometimes it’s better to write content that doesn’t rank than mediocre content that does.”
- stop worrying about THE definition and create your own meaning of quality. Just make sure your criteria match what your audience recognizes as quality too!
- When engineers contribute to technical content, when customer support shapes troubleshooting guides, when sales teams inform competitive positioning—the result is richer, more accurate, more valuable content that genuinely helps your audience.
- Set people up for success but don’t force them there.
- The point of a plan is merely to get moving. After that, a whole bunch of things you have and have not accounted for will occur, requiring you to adapt the plan along the way.
- What I’m trying to say—inelegantly—is that not all CEOs are jerks, and those who are tend to be bigger jerks than you imagine in ways you’ll never even see.
- Every physical person standing in your way has their own agenda, and that agenda is based on their emotions and their ego. The faster you learn to decode what’s behind the scenes of their objections, the faster you can get back to doing great work.
