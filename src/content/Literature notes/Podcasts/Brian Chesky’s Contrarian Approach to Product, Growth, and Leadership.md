## Highlights
- The Paradox of Leadership Involvement in Project Success
  Key takeaways:
  - No one person was dominant in the role of product manager during the early stages.
  - The speaker took on multiple roles including marketing, design, and operations.
  - As the company grew, the speaker became less involved in the product.
  - There was a paradox where inserting oneself into a project sometimes caused dysfunction.
  - The more involvement in a project, the more confusion and slower progress occurred.
  - Teams assumed the speaker's involvement was the cause of slow progress.
  - The speaker gave teams more control and empowerment, but they ended up moving slower.
  - Giving teams what they asked for resulted in them getting less of what they wanted.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I don't think any of us was that dominant. I probably played the closest thing to the role of the people listening, like the closest thing to the role of the product manager. But again, I did marketing, I did design, I did like ops, I did like kind of a little bit of everything. So I was basically everything about engineering. And then as we grew, I started getting more and more hands off in the product. And I always remember Lenny when you I heard this, there was this paradox where the lesson involved, I wasn't a project. I mean, there was there would be clear. There were times I inserted myself in dysfunction occurred. That is absolutely true. And I was just a learning experience for me. But there's this other scenario where the lesson ball buzz in the project, the more spin there was, the less clear the goals, the less advocacy the team had, the less resources, the fewer Resources they had. And then therefore the slower they moved and the slower they moved, the more they assumed it was because I was too involved. Right? Because people assume that that our natural equilibrium is to move fast, shift from being slow, it's because of an over involvement in leadership. And therefore I would get less involved. I would give teams more control. I would give them teams more empowerment. And the more I kept giving people what they asked for, initially they may have been happy, but the outcome of it was always seemed weirdly like they got less of what they wanted. They wanted to move faster. So I'd power them and they moved slower. ([Time 0:17:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dc349795-53bd-4b75-bd5d-395c8b0a8c2f))
- A Near Death Business Experience: Finding Clarity and Taking Action
  Key takeaways:
  - The company focused on short-term investments instead of long-term.
  - We lacked a clear understanding of our objectives.
  - Our work environment was challenging and productivity suffered as a result.
  - We experienced a loss in talented employees and rising costs.
  - Our growth was slowing down.
  - The pandemic caused a significant drop in our business.
  - This crisis made us realize the need to change our approach.
  - We took immediate action to reassess our business strategy.
  - The near-death experience gave us clarity and a fresh perspective.
  - We decided to prioritize a more detailed approach moving forward.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, we weren't investing in the long term. We were obsessing over hitting metrics. We didn't actually have any cohesive understanding of what we were doing. It was really hard to get work done. A lot of the great people were leaving and costs was rising and both growth are slowing. And that was exactly kind of what was happening. And then the pandemic occurred and we lost 80% of our business in eight weeks. And then suddenly we're like, oh my God, like I remember having a basically staring into the abyss. And luckily I've never had a near death experience, but the way it's been described to me is it's like your fly flashes before you are your eyes and you have clarity. And that's what happened to our business. We had a near death business experience and our business flash before our eyes. And so suddenly I basically got into action and I said, I'm going to run it this other way where I'm going to get back into the details.

- Streamlining Projects and Structure: Transitioning to a Functional Model
  Key takeaways:
  - One team should focus on three things, while three teams should focus on one thing.
  - Reducing the number of projects and layers of management can be beneficial.
  - Adopting a functional model similar to a startup can be advantageous.
  - Having fewer employees, particularly more senior ones, can prevent project slowdown.
  - Every executive should be an expert in their functional domain.
  - Design leaders should prioritize managing the design first and the people second.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So to set a one team doing three things, three teams should do one thing. So we totally cut down the number of projects. We removed layers of management. I wanted to be as few layers as possible from leaders of team. We went to a functional model. We went back to a startup. So we said, we're not going to have divisional leaders. We're going to have design, engineering, product, and which turned to product marketing and marketing, communications and sales and operations, all the functions of a startup. I said, we're going to have fewer employees. We're going to have fewer and more senior people. There's a great saying that the best way to slow a project down is to add more people to it. And so we felt like very few employees. We have fewer than 7,000 employees today. It's a relative comparison. I think Uber has 30,000. And it's not to say they're big. It's just say that's how small we are. And we've really benefited from having not a lot of employees. So we had, we made sure that every executive was an expert in their functional domain. So you know how there's a lot of engineering managers that aren't that technical or maybe not a lot, but they exist where there's designers, but there's design leaders who lead the people. A design leaders job should be managing the design first, the people second. That's what Johnny did or like they're interchangeable. I could never imagine Johnny of Apple just being a manager of people. He was looking and designing the work with the team. How do you manage the people without managing their work?

- Building a Marketing Communications and Creative Function
  Key takeaways:
  - Changes were made to build out a marketing communications and creative function
  - An in-house creative agency was built
  - UX writing and marketing writing were combined into one function called writing
  - Founders should not apologize for how they want to run a company
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I it's so these were these were like some of the changes that we made. We also started really building out much more of a marketing communications and creative function. We built our own in house creative agency. So we use production partners, but we don't use what we can do or chiter in those anymore. We actually build our own in house agency, so to speak, which is a creative group. The creative group does a lot of that, that the not just the ads, but the creative on the product. So we got really, really functional. We got rid of a function called UX writing and we combined it with marketing writing. We said, wait, aren't the best writers like, why don't we have the best writers do everything? Why is UX writing a separate function? Because actually the emails, the app, the ads should all be one voice. Now there may be people that come from a different background like there are people that come from UX, but they all roll up to one function of writing and writing should not go to design. Writing should go to a function called writing unless you want your head of writing to report to design. Then that doesn't make sense. So we really made a lot of those changes. Just if round up the question that you asked, I think that like way too many founders apologize for how they want to run the company. I don't know why they do, but I think they apologize for how they run the company. ([Time 0:30:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/be42f6e4-2b7d-4938-a126-d13c2ef436b2))
- Finding Common Ground: Balancing Leadership and Employee Expectations
  Key takeaways:
  - A midpoint between how a company is run and how the employees want to run it can lead to dissatisfaction and lack of clarity.
  - Clarity and a shared direction are what everyone wants in a company.
  - Appeasing employees may not always be effective, as they may leave before the completion of a project.
  - Leaders have to be involved in every detail without micromanaging.
  - Being in the details is essential for leaders to ensure that people are doing a good job.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They basically find some midpoint between how they want to run a company and how the people they lead want to run the company. If you're a founder, what I would tell you is the problem with finding a negotiation between how you want to run a company, the people you want, is that's a good way to make everyone miserable. Because everyone really wants this clarity. What everyone really wants is to be able to row in the same direction really quickly. And also if you try to appease employees, they may not even be there for the whole time. So we have entire projects, the company where somebody advocated to do it. It was a big commitment and then they left. And now we're still doing the project they advocated for. So it really has to be something that everyone wants to sign up for. Not just the person who's there because they might not always be there. And so I basically got involved in every single detail. And I basically told leaders that leaders are in the details. And there's this negative term called micromanagement. And I think there's a difference between micromanagement, which is like telling people exactly what to do and being in the details. Being in the details is what every responsible company's board does to the CEO. It doesn't mean the board is telling them what to do. But if you don't know the details, how do you know people are doing a good job? People think that great leaders' job is to hire people and just empower them to do a good job. Well, how do you know they're doing a good job if you're not in the details? ([Time 0:31:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6688bf8c-0345-450e-8607-671d29f1a04f))
- The Role of a CEO as a Product Officer and the Importance of Interconnectivity in Product Management
  Key takeaways:
  - The CEO should see themselves as a product officer and be involved in the product.
  - Product managers should be interconnected and aware of each other's work.
  - Leaders should be knowledgeable about the area they're leading.
  - Teams should aim to have as few members as possible.
  - Teams should focus on doing one thing well rather than spreading themselves too thin.
  - Consider packaging and telling a story during product launches.
  - Teams should utilize both data and research/intuition.
  - Understanding cannot be delegated.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Number one, I think that the CEO, unless they're not a product person, should think of themselves as a cheap product officer and they should be involved in the product. Number two, if you're not functional, I would at least think about everyone being really close together. So here's another way of saying it, Laney. Every product manager should be interconnected and know what everyone else is doing. They shouldn't be independently siloed unless they're really are running like separate companies or separate orgs and they have no dependencies. I think that every leader should be an expert in what they're leading. There should be no people, managers and entire company. And when I say people, managers, meaning your only responsibility is people, not the work or not the domain because you can't manage people, the void of their work. Imagine like a fire chief, they don't know anything about putting out fires. That's crazy. You have to know the subject matter. People should aim to have as few people as possible on their team. I'm not saying eliminate people. I mean, grow slowly and do not be reckless. Five teams should do one thing. Rather than one team do five things. So that's just a metaphor. But people should work together. I think that people should consider doing launches. You can, by the way, ship every hour of every day, but then package it and tell a story if you want to hold the product back. I think that team should use data, but they should also use research and intuition. There's a designer called Charles Ames that said you can't delegate understanding.

- The Importance of Understanding in AB Experiments and Data Measurement
  Key takeaways:
  - Understanding the meaning of AB experiments and data measurement is crucial.
  - Having engineering and design report to the product-led founder is ideal.
  - Product managers should have a combination of art and science and be responsible for distribution, customer understanding, and storytelling.
  - Technical product managers should not work with non-technical functions.
  - Marketing and engineering should be interconnected.
  - There should be a few layers between the CEO and other employees.
  - Each release should be treated as a chapter of a story or an episode of a TV series.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If you're going to do AB experiments or measure data, you have to understand what it means. I think that you have to have an intuition. It tuition comes not from arbitraryness. It comes from understanding. I would make sure that you have engineering and design, ideally report to the founder product led person. I would not have designed under product unless you have an extreme, a good reason the product person kind of is a designer. I would try to think about product management expanding the responsibility and including distribution, understanding the customer and teaching people how to tell a story. I would try to make sure that the product managers are a combination of art and science. I do not think you want purely technical product managers doing things if they're going to work with non-technical functions. If they're only working technical functions, that's fine, but they don't work in non-technical functions. I think that's a problem. I would make sure that marketing and engineering are interconnected. I would make sure that you have a few layers between the CEO and other people. If you're a CEO, every direct to your direct should be an implicit dotted line to you. I treat every direct to my direct as if they're a direct report, a dotted line. I don't try to conflict with the direction of my team, but I always want to know what another layer below me is doing. I think you should think of each release as a chapter of a story or like an episode of TV series. ([Time 0:36:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/14812589-a3fd-4f76-a968-e340d71c5693))
- Expanding the Role of Product Management
  Key takeaways:
  - Product management should include responsibilities such as distribution, customer understanding, and storytelling.
  - Product managers should have a balance of art and science and not be solely technical.
  - Marketing and engineering should be interconnected.
  - There should be a few layers between the CEO and other employees.
  - Each release should be treated as a chapter in a story.
  - Companies should have a long-term story or vision.
  - It is important for everyone in the company to work towards the same direction.

I think you should think of each release as a chapter of a story or like an episode of TV series. You should think of your company in a five or ten years story. You may not know where you are in ten years, but you're telling this ongoing story. Most of all, I would say that everyone should row in the same direction. If there's only one thing I said in this interview today, I'm not sure what it would be, but I think a good candidate is try to get everyone to row together in the same direction. Otherwise, why the hell are you all in the same company? ([Time 0:37:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/83c72b04-13dd-4d28-a527-3ea49db85f8e))
- Improving Company Speed: Make Faster Decisions
  Key takeaways:
  - The pace of a company is often determined by the decisiveness of its decision-making.
  - Fast decisions come from having a bias for action and avoiding unnecessary delays.
  - A leader should encourage individuals to do their best and help them realize their untapped potential.
  - Being proactive and taking responsibility can result in accomplishing three months of work in a shorter time period.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And that pace is sometimes governed not by how hard people work, but how decisive they are. If you want to improve the speed of a company, then make faster decisions. And that fast decisions come from a bias of action. If we're in a meeting, we don't just say like, okay, like let's circle back on this next week. No, we'll have it done by next week. Let's stay in this meeting till it's done. What are you doing? Have a bias for action. Who's responsible? Okay. What are you doing? Okay. Let's check in an hour. I'll call you in the morning. Okay. How are we doing this? And so you end up getting three months of work done over that period of time. But the last thing I'll say about adding a zero Lenny is I remember there was a story about a great basketball coach named John Wooden. He was one of the winningest basketball coaches, I think in college basketball history, perhaps the greatest. And someone asked him once, I'm going to paraphrase what he said, like, what is your secret to success? And he said that, you know, I just asked my players to do their very best. And I remember thinking to myself, that doesn't sound like the secret to success, asking people to do their best. But there was an implicit thing that he didn't say, which is that he saw potential people that they never saw in themselves. And so the role of a leader is to see potential in people that they may not even see themselves. ([Time 0:47:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0202c2f4-572b-48ce-994f-9456655b6e16))
- How Prioritizing Good Surprises and Early Intervention Can Lead to More Time on Your Hands
  Key takeaways:
  - Getting involved in projects early on prevents dysfunction and reduces the amount of work required to fix issues later.
  - Having a better work-life balance can lead to more time available and less burnout.
  - There is a temptation to work more and more hours, but stepping away from work can lead to better results and increased productivity.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Before, I would get 10 surprises and nine were bad. Now I get 10 surprises and nine are good. And you don't really have to do anything about good surprises, only bad surprises. That I used to have to intervene in projects that I wasn't involved in because they were going off in the wrong direction. And by the time I got involved, I was associated with dysfunction. But I only got involved because it was dysfunctional. It wasn't actually going well. And then it was three times his work to fix something because we weren't involved in the very early eight stages. So I was much more involved. I had a lot less time I hands initially. And now I actually weirdly have a lot more time on my hands. But the answer question I'm burned out, I think is another very good question. I do not think I'm the poster child, at least historically, of work life balance. I'm 42 years old. I live with a golden retriever. I don't yet have a family. And if you ask me when I was in college, how I thought my life would be right now, I probably would have thought the inverse. That I have a family and I'd one day run a company. And I did things in a slightly different order. But one of the things I've learned is that there's this temptation to work more and more and more hours. And sometimes you just say that's an artist, you have to step away from the painting. And you actually start getting more derivatives slower and slower. And so I basically have tried to pre-guit a practice to step away from the work.
