## Highlights
- **Rarity of Firm Sales**
  - Only a small fraction of professional services firms get sold (1 in 400). 
  - Selling is rare but impactful, like winning the lottery.
  Transcript:
  David C. Baker
  Depending on which source you look at, let's say there's 55,000 firms in the U.S. Now, most of our clients are outside the U.S., but just using the U.S. As an example, all things being equal. So if you don't categorize anybody in there, just take the whole number, about one in 400 will sell over their lifetime. You can change those odds dramatically with some changes to how you run things and so on. But I would say there are probably 15 to 20 of us in the M&A space just for marketing, advertising, digital, and so on. And I would guess that there are probably a thousand transactions a year somewhere in there. Not sure. So it's rare, but when it happens to you, it really matters. It's sort of like the lottery, I guess, or getting struck by ([Time 0:03:38](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c2c686ee-a9eb-40d9-b202-c5138c20f299))
- **Not a Get-Rich-Quick Scheme**
  - Selling professional service firms isn't a "get-rich-quick" scheme. 
  - These firms are often owner-operated and not passive investments.
  Transcript:
  Blair Enns
  Probably over the years. Okay. So you have some experience in this space. It's interesting. Point out at the beginning of the book that this isn't exactly a field where people say, hey, let's get into this business, spin something up and then exit, then sell it. Is it?
  David C. Baker
  No, no. And you're wondering why? Like that's something we probably ought to... There's no money in it? Is that it? Well, that's a small detail. No, this is something where it'd be fun to really put our heads together and figure that out. I was thinking about investing outside the stuff I read about, and I was thinking about that. So now I was thinking, oh, you know, these young entrepreneurs, a lot of them male, want to buy something that they would view as a passive investment. In other words, they just buy it, and they've got to poke their head in the door every once in a while, and then it grows pretty regularly over time, and then they have an exit, and then they Can change their LinkedIn profile and all of that. So when they look a little bit deeper into this kind of a firm, they realize, oh, in almost every case, the president, founder, whatever, is also working in the firm. That's interesting. So either you have to know a lot to do this, or is it a lifestyle business? So I'm just kind of thinking out loud here. That's part of it. They're not passive investments. By lifestyle business, I don't really like that term because it's kind of pejorative, but I just mean you're participating because you enjoy it, not just because you want to own a firm. And then in the scheme of things, they're smaller and probably nominally profitable as that lifestyle sort of business. So somebody on the outside would say, I think I'll buy a storage place first. Yeah. ([Time 0:05:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1ab9595b-ce4f-4e17-9ef2-6b784c009b29))
- **Internal Sales Advice**
  - Internal sales can be successful, especially with a natural successor. 
  - Consider if the employee is entrepreneurial and funding options.
  Transcript:
  Blair Enns
  You okay starting with internal sale to a key employee? Because it seems to me that that is one of the, over the years, you know, some of these are more in vogue than others at certain times, but this seems to be the common one. Is that correct?
  David C. Baker
  Yes. Sometimes it's the first choice, right? I've worked with this person. They've been a fantastic employee, key employee. I want this firm to continue. This is what makes it that most likely to happen. And then other times it's the very last choice because no outside buyer appeared in the process. So it can happen for all sorts of reasons. Frankly, I love to see it happen. And many of these are successful. I would guess, I don't have specific stats, but I would guess that most of them are successful. What holds them back is a couple of things, and it could be one or a combination of these. Often it's the money side, right? So if somebody had the money, would they buy this firm with it? Usually if that's the choice, they go start their own. So they don't have the money. So then they have to look for outside money from friends, family, whatever. And the most common place now is the SBA 7A loan, which you can use. I think it's up to 5 million or something like that. And it's fairly easy to qualify and so on. If that doesn't work, then the owner has to what's called carry the note. So they have to loan the money. So they have a really strong vested interest in staying around at least close enough to monitor how the firm is doing. And it gets a little yucky. So those are some of the challenges of it. The problem on the principal side is that if you have multiple people, it's very difficult for you emotionally to make a choice and to select one of those because of the signal it sends To somebody else. And so you'll often and inappropriately just sort of approach the team to buy you out. That's one of the challenges there. Another is just whether the person who you're in discussions with is actually entrepreneurial. Some people are working for you because they're not entrepreneurial and they never will be. Other people are working for you as a stepping stone to be an entrepreneur somewhere. So anyway, I'll stop talking, but that's sort of a rough outline of that stuff.
  Blair Enns
  It occurs to me that of these 10 different options you have when it comes to selling your firm, we could do podcast episodes on all 10. In fact, we have done some of these. We have done dedicated episodes to some of these. I'm grinning as you described the principle, trying to combine a team of people whom they think it would make sense to participate in the purchase of the firm and basically saddling These team members with each other. Kind of what happens in an ESOP as well. I've seen that go wrong. We could dwell on this, but we won't. So you say sometimes it's the last resort, sometimes it's the first resort. When it happens, it's a pretty satisfying thing to witness, I imagine, when there's a clear, obvious, key employee where everybody's rooting for that person to be the next owner of The firm. I'm sure you've seen a bunch of those and you feel the satisfaction of participating in that transition.
  David C. Baker
  Absolutely. Yeah. And especially the ones that are really fun to do are the ones where you make the announcement to the team and nobody's surprised. It's like, yeah, we figured like he or she, like that's a natural leader. We've been listening and we've seen the transition happen informally and so on. So if it can happen, that's fantastic. And there are a lot of really good stories of that happening. ([Time 0:08:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c5964110-4207-427d-9371-ec8e4c85c30b))
- **Private Equity Focus**
  - Private equity buyers focus on growth potential, not just current profit. 
  - Be prepared for intense negotiations and their different focus.
  Transcript:
  Blair Enns
  So yeah, it's over. You have to be serious. Yeah. There's no turning point here. You're moving forward. Yeah. Fourth on your list where I wanted to spend a couple of minutes as well as private equity, because it seems to me there is something in the air. It's maybe a slight exaggeration to say every week I'm talking to somebody who has sold their firm to private equity or is considering it. Is that an exaggeration? Are you seeing it as more commonly? No, that's the same thing. Yeah. What's going on? Why is that? Yeah. You kind of wonder when these PE firms are going to wake up, right? No, it can work really well. Well, I think they're actually making money. I think most of them know what they're doing, don't you? Yeah. In many cases, they are making money.
  David C. Baker
  Yeah. You know, when we're managing this kind of a sale, either on the buyer, the sell side, if we're with a PE firm, it's always on the sell side. You can expect a very different transaction. They're going to have professional managers and negotiators on the other side of the table, right? They may bring four people, one CPA and three attorneys, right? So you have to be prepared. You have to know how to navigate that. They ask very different questions and they'll say, can we get a copy of your last quality of earnings report? And somebody who's running an agency is like, uh, sure. And then they go ask somebody what that is. It's something you have to go pay another consultant to do. Yeah, right, exactly. They also care a lot more about your growth pattern. They care more about your profit percentage. They'll care a lot more about not so much your new business plan, but how many of your clients are on a recurring revenue arrangement. And then you have to realize that they're going to sell your firm someday. There's no PE firm in the world that has kept a firm forever. They are going to sell it. So there will be expectations you have to decide. I think it can be a fantastic option, and sometimes it's not. It's just different than selling to an internal buyer. Yeah. And more than any other buyer, as you point out in the book, they are really focused on growth.
  Blair Enns
  They're not buying net present cash flow. They're buying an expectation of future cash flow at a significant increase. So they're looking at your firm thinking, can we buy this, grow it, grow it in top line and bottom line, and then sell it again? Yeah.
  David C. Baker
  They're looking at you kind of like they want to see a small, really well-tuned engine with all kinds of processes and a way to fill the new business pipeline. And then they're just going to put more gasoline on that fire because they don't know how you do what you do. They're just going to say, hey, talk to me about these financial results. And do you need more money? Like all of their interaction with you is about money, which is gasoline on the fire.
  Blair Enns
  And are you encountering more and more PE firms that specialize in this space? Yeah. I'm seeing them. I can't keep track of them, but I hear a small number of names that come up over and over again.
  David C. Baker
  There's at least 10, probably closer to 15. They might focus on tech, Martech. I know there's one on higher ed, for instance. Our friend Hamid Ganadan, what's the space he's in? Biotech. Yeah, there's ones on biotech and so on. So yeah, for sure. Of ([Time 0:12:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/abf432af-ab94-4d6e-90e9-74dad57049e0))
- **Roll-Up Strategies**
  - Roll-ups, sometimes backed by PE, aim for larger acquisitions or holding companies. 
  - They often use the acquired firm's assets for further purchases, impacting seller returns.
  Transcript:
  Blair Enns
  Your 10 options here when selling, the other one I wanted to speak to is just a little bit was roll-up because it seems to me, you know, over the years, you see roll-ups kind of come and go. They're in vogue or they're not in vogue. The difference that I see today, and you didn't really speak to this in the book, but I was hoping maybe we could speak to it. That's what PE is doing, right? I think the difference is PE is backing these roll-ups where it used to be a really entrepreneurial agency principle typically would start buying other agencies.
  David C. Baker
  Is that the difference? Well, with the PE firm, the exit is almost always going to be selling it to another firm or to go on publicly traded markets. But that's not always the case with a roll-up. A roll-up might very well be doing one of those same things that PE firm is, but in other cases, they just want to be the next holding company, so to speak. There's a couple of those growing that way. In other cases, they want to sell to somebody that wouldn't buy all these little firms and wouldn't pay exorbitantly for all of this together, but it's going to be a pretty decent profit Because a roll-up basically spends very little money of their own. That's sort of why it's bad for the seller in most cases, because they're assuming that they get your balance sheet, which they're going to use to fund the next purchase and so on. So there's a lot of overlap and there are PE-backed roll-ups, but there are differences too. ([Time 0:15:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e51424f2-5b35-40c5-a28d-73d2c400fa1e))
- **Valuation Considerations**
  - Don't underpay yourself to inflate EBITDA; buyers will normalize it. 
  - Buyers might not care as much about second-level teams as sellers assume.
  Transcript:
  Blair Enns
  Okay. So let's speak now to the listener who is considering selling their firm. They're trying on this idea. They're thinking about reaching out to you. Beyond profit, what are some of the less obvious things that buyers care about? And I'm thinking maybe some of the things that might surprise the seller. Not just profit that's being purchased. And we've probably touched on a couple of these in other episodes, but can you hit the highlights here? What's a buyer looking for beyond just the obvious of profit and profit trend?
  David C. Baker
  Man, the first half a dozen things come to mind, but the first one is just so glaringly different from the rest because it always happens and it's almost always a surprise. It's always a surprise in one direction or the other. What I mean is it's almost always a bad surprise. It's normalizing principal comp. So if you have been achieving, let's just say you want to achieve a 20% EBITDA every year and you've been hitting it, but you've been doing that in part by underpaying yourself. Well, the buyer, they're going to adjust all that or normalize it. And so that's probably the first thing I would say is the fact that you're not doing yourself any favor by underpaying yourself.
  Blair Enns
  So you think you've got a business that has an EBITDA of 20% and you're quite proud of it. And others look at the numbers and say, well, you only paid yourself a salary of $50,000 when maybe it should have been $350,000. So you're artificially inflating your EBITDA by decreasing your salary. Is that what you're speaking about? Yeah.
  David C. Baker
  And in some cases, the owner of the principal of this firm is so unsophisticated financially that all along they've been assuming that their profit at the end of the year is their salary. And the problem is you can't count it twice. It's either EBITDA or it's comp. So yeah, that's kind of a surprise. Other things that kind of come up that maybe people, if they thought about carefully, they might have anticipated, but it still kind of comes out of the blue for them is how the seller's Really nervous about client concentration. And sometimes the buyer is, but sometimes they just say, oh, don't worry about it. We'll build that into the terms and not the price. So that's a pleasant surprise for people to hear. I think everybody kind of expects that a multiple of EBITDA at your firm is where it's going to start, but they might be surprised that the buyer doesn't even pay attention to it if they're Not buying it for financial reasons. They might be buying it for capacity or for a geographic presence or for a recruiting hub or something like that. So those are some of the surprises. I'll give you one other one. Sellers think that buyers are going to care a lot about that second level team. And I think it surprises them most of the time that there's fewer and fewer questions about them. They just kind of assume that you've made a good choice there. They know you're going to be, in almost every case, there for an early portion of the earn out. And so they figure, well, if there's a problem, she'll take care of it. So that's something that surprises them too. Well, ([Time 0:16:57](https://share.snipd.com/snip/50487b42-a93e-47e5-a46e-5682387a6649))
- **Cash and Earnouts**
  - Typical cash at closing is one-half to two-thirds of the purchase price, tied to earnouts. 
  - Earnout periods are now typically three years or less.
  Transcript:
  Blair Enns
  Let me jump ahead a little bit and just pull on this thread a little bit more. Talk about cash on closing and earnouts because you're referencing the principal staying. I know of some examples where principals just sold at a discount so they could walk away early.
  David C. Baker
  That's not typical in this space, I don't believe, is it? No, it's not. We've done the range of cash at closing as a percentage of the purchase price. That would range from zero to a when I look across all of the deals that we've done. But typically, you kind of just assume that the cash at closing is going to be somewhere between one half and two thirds, maybe, depending on the deal. Every once in a while, it's more. Other times, it's less. And you really have to balance the price with the terms because people focus too much on price. They should be thinking more about terms. And you can sign whatever you want. Now, you can leave at any point. I mean, your employment agreement will end and the terms of the earn out might mean you get a whole lot less money, but you can always leave if you need to. More or maybe equally as important is how long the earn out is, right? Because if it's just a year, you probably can endure something more than you could if it was, none of them are more than three years anymore. They used to be five years, but now they're ([Time 0:21:25](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1fdad1e6-2e26-458f-8b59-498198fa2785))
- **Maintain Business Focus**
  - Focus on business optimization, even during a sale process. 
  - Maintaining a strong business offers leverage and walk-away power.
  Transcript:
  Blair Enns
  Yeah, you've got a really interesting to me chapter on contesting the valuation. It's really a bit of a detailed negotiating playbook. It's probably too deep to get into here. In fact, we could probably do a whole episode on that if you want to do that in the future. That might be interesting to do. Yeah.
  David C. Baker
  I don't remember for sure, but I think I kind of apologized at the beginning of that chapter because basically, this is how you screw the person who bought you and is not living up to their Word. And it's also because we design these if we're working for the buyer or we'll negotiate them if we're working for the seller, you kind of know exactly what you would do. It's like, ah, I've worked at that bank a long time. I know exactly how I would rob it at this point. So that's what that chapter is about. It's just all the ways that you can maximize your opportunities if the working relationship has faltered. If it hasn't, then you ought to stick with the spirit of the agreement and not use any of those loopholes. But there are ([Time 0:25:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/2836b315-b417-41cd-8230-21cd0eb79159))
- **Evaluate LOI Practices**
  - Be wary of buyers who issue LOIs readily without deep initial engagement. 
  - They might use it as a tactic to gauge desperation and renegotiate later.
  Transcript:
  Blair Enns
  Loopholes and there are ways to use them. Looking for the chapter now, that's escaping me, but there's a part where you talk about the letter of intent and you basically say there's two different types of buyers where one will Invest a lot of time ahead of the letter of intent and one will invest a lot of time after the letter of intent. They issue letters of intent or LOIs pretty readily. And this had never occurred to me before, but as you were describing it, I was thinking, oh yeah, I've seen both of these. How about requests for proposals too, right? Yeah, it's really the same thing, isn't it? Yeah. The client who's just like, well, let's send an RFP to 12 firms. Let's issue an LOI to four or five different firms. We don't really have a strong preference for either. Let's just shake it out. Let's drag out the negotiation, the due diligence and negotiation process. So that's beyond saying it's quite similar to the RFP behaviors that some buyers demonstrate when issuing RFPs. What else would you care to say about it?
  David C. Baker
  If you have a serious, respectful buyer, they're also careful about how they make acquisitions. And so they're going to do a lot of thinking and asking questions before they send you an LOI. They also will probably not give you busy work because of their experience and because of their level of respect for you. So when you get an LOI at that stage from that sort of a potential buyer, all they're doing after you sign it is just verifying the assumptions. And they're not looking to change any of the terms. They're just like verify these and make sure we're okay. And that due diligence period is shorter, too. It might be six or eight weeks instead of four to five months, right? The other kind of buyer is the one that it's just they don't really have a strategy. They're hoping to see who will send signals of urgency or desperation. And there's no cost to them, just like that client you were talking about that said, hey, let's send an RFP request to 12 firms. Well, it's no skin off their teeth, just a little bit more to read, right? But everybody else is the one jumping around. So they do this and often you can spot these because they don't spend a lot of time getting to know you and you're kind of surprised that you got an LOI after that. It's like, wow, that's really flattering when it isn't necessarily the case. The other way to see them is that they will send you a list of materials to send that they just copied off of Google somewhere. It's like, please send your such and such. How frequently do you oil the tractors or something? And those are the firms where they'll see how desperate you are. You'll have to do all this work to clarify their expectations. You'll send this stuff to them. And meanwhile, they're having to sort through four of these instead of one. And they get in and they say, oh, oh, well, we didn't realize such and such, you know, some of the most basic facts about your firm's performance. And then you've waited all this time and done all this work and you feel a little bit trapped. So there's ways to see these signals all over the place. This is just one example of how professional, how serious it is, what the culture is going to be like too, because that's really, how do you say it? The sale is a sample. It's like, yeah, the dating here is the marriage. And so how you're treated here, it should send you sort of a pretty reliable signal ([Time 0:26:10](https://share.snipd.com/snip/c318a4c0-3ce0-497e-8f67-c6b85979fd67))
- **Seller's Remorse**
  - Sellers rarely regret the act of selling but often regret the buyer or terms. 
  - Many wish they'd been more selfish, especially regarding earnout structures.
  Transcript:
  Blair Enns
  I'll have ChatGPT write up an offer and then I will drag out the negotiating process for over a year. Right. And send it to eight other people too. Last question. So you and I know lots of principles of these firms who have sold and you can put them into two camps, never been happier, best thing they ever did. And also the other camp of, oh, he lost his identity and his sense of purpose and he died six months later. Recognizing you have a bias here. You help people sell their firms. What's your observation? Generally, if you make a generalization, are these principles who sell, are they appreciative, grateful? Do they look back on the decision that it was the right one? Or how often do you see the pattern of, oh, I should have kept it. That's Dan Sullivan's advice. Really? Founders, strategic coaches. You sell your business, then what are you going to do? You're going to start another one. So just fix the one you've got.
  David C. Baker
  Yeah. I think that to answer your question specifically, that principal who sells very seldom regrets selling. In fact, once that idea is in your head, I don't know what percentage, maybe a fourth of people actually fix the problem that was underlying that hatred of your business. And then they go on and love it and just give themselves a dope slap that they ever thought about selling it. Right. So that happens sometimes. But for a lot of the people, once you have that idea of selling, you're going to sell. So I don't think people regret selling. I think they regret selling to the wrong firm, the wrong buyer, and with the wrong terms, maybe half the time, I would guess, they sold to the wrong buyer. Yeah. They kind of wish they'd been a little bit more selfish. You know, they don't come right out and say it, but if you get them talking after a few beers, I'll bet you they would say that. And I have had many people actually tell me that. Meaning they felt in hindsight, they were too generous to their team in participating in the sale. Right. And then just thinking about the earn out experience, roughly, I would say a third of the sellers really loved it. It was great. A third of them thought, this is kind of what I expected. It's okay. I like these people. I'll be fine quitting, but I like coming to work every day, you know, that kind of middle stuff. And then a third have renamed the earn out to a sentence and they're like, oh, I got to get out of here. And they kind of knew. It's like it wasn't usually a surprise, but they didn't know it was quite that bad. And they just hate every minute of it.
