## Highlights
- I think it's actually a good sign to not remember your dream. To me, it means that your whole brain was asleep and doing what it should be doing, which is not recording new memories, but rather processing old memories. Don't worry about it.

- Episode AI notes
  1. Leaving electronics outside the bedroom can improve social emotional performance in teenagers.
  2. Keeping devices in the kitchen charging is an effective strategy to keep electronics out of the bedroom.
  3. Consistency in bedtime routine and timing is crucial for better cognitive outcomes in older individuals.
  4. Exposing oneself to bright light in the morning helps reset the circadian clock and promotes better sleep at night.
  5. Going to bed at a consistent time is important for optimal brain functioning.
  6. Missing a night's sleep or going to bed late once will not have a long-term impact on sleep patterns.
  7. Our brain adjusts and tries to make up for lost sleep by allowing us to catch up on deep slow wave sleep by going to bed earlier.
  8. The brain has specific times when it functions best, and missing that window for sleep can have negative effects.
  9. The brain can adjust to make up for lost sleep, but there are limits to its ability to do so.
  10. Consistently not getting enough sleep can negatively impact the immune system and its ability to learn through sleep.
  11. Sleep plays a crucial role in our immune system's ability to learn and respond.
  12. Skipping sleep or having disrupted sleep can lead to a compromised immune system.
  13. Even one night of no sleep can negatively impact the immune system and upregulate stress responses.
  14. Quality sleep within a specific timeframe after receiving a vaccine is important for its effectiveness.
  15. Alcohol consumption and poor sleep quality can reduce vaccine effectiveness.
  16. Lack of sleep compromises the immune system and increases natural killer cell activity.
  17. Sleep deprivation impairs learning from immune challenges and weakens the ability to fight specific viruses.
  18. The immune response signals the brain to need more sleep when fighting an infection.
  19. Depriving someone of sleep while they're fighting an infection significantly delays their recovery. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/181e2d95-b902-4b7e-9b5a-17289f36e2c3))
- Optimizing Sleep Habits for Better Cognitive Outcomes
  Key takeaways:
  - Teenagers who have electronics far from them outside the room have better social emotional performance.
  - Leaving devices in the kitchen charging on the only available chargers can be effective in keeping electronics outside the bedroom.
  - Consistency in bedtime routine and timing is important for better cognitive outcomes especially for older people.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  It sounds like no electronics, maybe in the bedroom, if you can get away with that as a parent, might be a good sort of... Oh, absolutely.
  Speaker 1
  And it's been shown in study after study that teenagers that have electronics far from them outside the room have much better social emotional performance. What have you seen work there? What's effective? Leave your device in the kitchen? Or what do you... Leave your device in the kitchen charging on a...
  Speaker 2
  But the only chargers available in the house outside your bedroom. And then talk to me about the importance of routine and timing of sleep. Like how important is the two to three hours leading up to sleep and then sort of like the consistency around times we go to bed and how that impacts us.
  Speaker 1
  There have been studies to show that the more volatile your sleep onset time, the worse the cognitive outcomes for older people. So it hasn't really been studied as much in younger people. But if you have a regular bedtime in older people, it's predictive of better cognitive outcomes. ([Time 0:24:24](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9fe738a0-484c-44a8-abf4-6ed18c8c25f1))
- - Our bodies have limits to adjusting for sleep deprivation, and lack of sleep affects our immune system's ability to respond effectively
  - Alcohol consumption and poor sleep quality can reduce vaccine effectiveness by at least 50%
  - Researchers like Mark Op and Jim Kruger have conducted studies linking sleep deprivation to compromised immune system ([Time 0:34:32](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fc3f4413-b227-4d3d-8916-9b3f3d6976f1))

- The Impact of Sleep on our Immune System
  Key takeaways:
  - Great researchers have shown that lack of sleep compromises the immune system and upregulates the natural killer cells.
  - Sleep deprivation impairs learning from immune challenges and weakens the ability to fight specific viruses.
  - The immune response signals the brain to need more sleep when fighting an infection, and sleep deprivation slows recovery.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  There's a couple of great researchers. Mark Op is one of them. He's at the University of Colorado Boulder. And Jim Kruger, he's at Washington State University. They've done a lot of really good studies to show that our immune system is definitely compromised. The first thing that happens with no sleep, one night, is our natural killer sounds get upregulated so because it's a highly stressful situation for our bodies not to get a night sleep. And so our immune system goes on high alert and says what's going on, what do we need to pay attention to. And so that's good. That helps protect us from any kind of acute insults that day. But it also makes us unable to learn from those things. So we'll learn from whatever immune challenges that you had during that day. And if you're exposed to a virus, for example, you aren't as able to rally your soldiers, your immune soldiers to fight that virus. You will not be able to generate the specific soldiers to fight that specific virus. And so you'll probably get sick.
  Speaker 2
  Why do we sleep more when we're sick or attend to you? Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  So there is some good studies to show that the immune response actually signals our brain that we need more sleep. So, and it's kind of unknown exactly what's going on and why your body needs more sleep. But if you deprive someone of sleep at the time that they're fighting an infection, they will not get better nearly as quickly.
