I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our long time podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina. Yes, thank you for having me on, Lenny. What is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like RAMP, VantaScale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs. Yes, so we just launched OneSchema File Feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFDP folder.
