## Highlights
- Episode AI notes
  1. Constantly striving for more can lead to a comparison game with competitors, which may not accurately reflect what users actually want or if the product is user-friendly.
  2. Checklists and features alone cannot determine the value of a product. Important features like simplicity and user-friendliness cannot be measured through checklists.
  3. The true test of a product is when someone starts using it, not just in the store. Basecamp emphasizes the importance of a product being good 'at home' rather than just 'in store'.
  4. The concept of blue ocean strategy suggests focusing on areas of exceptionalism rather than trying to be the best at everything, acknowledging that it's impossible to excel in all metrics all the time.
  5. Recognizing the importance of simplicity and exceptionalism can lead to creating unforgettable products that attract loyal fans. ([TimeÂ 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/66a3d4b3-6705-4f70-b3ed-2bfeb765204c))
