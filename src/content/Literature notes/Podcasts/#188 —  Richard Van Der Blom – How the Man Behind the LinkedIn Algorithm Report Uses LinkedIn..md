Let me tell you about one of my favorite podcasts that I've been listening to for years. It's called the $100 MBA show. And wherever you are on your business journey, the $100 MBA show has lessons that can help you take the next step forward. The $100 MBA show is a best of Apple podcast winner, literally one of the top Apple podcasts of all time and is hosted by my friend and former guest Omar Zenholm. Omar is a business school dropout, turns successful entrepreneur and he shares real-world lessons on starting growing and scaling your business. You may even know his software product, webinar ninja. What I love about the $100 MBA show is that these are well produced, bite-sized episodes on everything from creating a product, connecting with your market, sales, building a team And more. This show is legit. It does over 2 million downloads every month. Whether you're a small-time solopreneur or scaling your startup to investor level, there's valuable real-world advice for you in the $100 MBA archive of thousands of episodes with New episodes three days a week. If that sounds interesting to you and it should, just search for $100 MBA show wherever you get your podcasts. This episode is sponsored by podcast movement.
