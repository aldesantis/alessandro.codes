## Highlights
- The five key factors could have been taken right out of Bill Campbell’s playbook.

- If you have the right conversation, Bill counseled, then eight out of ten times people will reach the best conclusion on their own.

- Bill’s point of view on this was that letting people go is a failure of management, not one of any of the people who are being let go. So it is important for management to let people leave with their heads held high. Treat them well, with respect. Be generous with severance packages. Send out a note internally celebrating their accomplishments. ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFKHCNY&location=900))

- “mundane, almost trivial” things like listening and chatting with employees are important aspects of successful leadership, because “people feel more respected, visible and less anonymous, and included in teamwork.” ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFKHCNY&location=1135))

- PRACTICE FREE-FORM LISTENING LISTEN TO PEOPLE WITH YOUR FULL AND UNDIVIDED ATTENTION—DON’T THINK AHEAD TO WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO SAY NEXT—AND ASK QUESTIONS TO GET TO THE REAL ISSUE. ([Location 1144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07JFKHCNY&location=1144))
