## Highlights
- The secret to getting people together is this: build your community with people, not for them. ([Location 69](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=69))
- Nearly every challenge of building a community can be met by asking yourself, “How do I achieve this by working with my people, not doing it for them?” In other words, approach community-building as progressive acts of collaboration—doing more with others every step of the way. ([Location 71](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=71))
- To figure out who to focus on, start with two questions: 1. Who do I want to get together? 2. Why are we coming together? ([Location 132](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=132))
- It’s scary to talk to strangers. Guide your members into discussions by modeling what good participation looks like. Craft regular prompts and make introductions for newbies. ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=481))
- When implemented with care, ground rules and moderation can facilitate and reward focused, sincere conversations. Structure also supports healthy debate when conflict arises. ([Location 484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07TXDDNPR&location=484))
