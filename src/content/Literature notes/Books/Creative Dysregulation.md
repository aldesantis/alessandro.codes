## Highlights
- Identity creative regulation means you embrace who you truly are: a magnificent creative being capable of creating anything within yourself. Any view of yourself that is less than this is, in my opinion, a sign of identity dysregulation. To heal it, you must develop a fluid, expansive view of yourself as a creative being, becoming liberated from external influences and finding your source of identity from within.

- Watch out for an initial spark of healthy intrinsic motivation changing into unhealthy extrinsic motivation once you receive validation and encouragement from others. I find it best to consistently check in with myself as I’m creating on where my motivation is coming from (it is fluid and can change) with a question like, “*What is driving me right now to create?*” If I find myself hijacked by external influences or internalized ‘shoulds,’ I slow down and recalibrate.

- If you only focus on yourself, what you create may lack resonance with others, and if you only focus on them, what you create may lack resonance with you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j270xfrh1bg01s05n3rzcmwa))
