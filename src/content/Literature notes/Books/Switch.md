## Highlights
- And that’s the first surprise about change: What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. ([Location 75](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=75))
    - Tags: [[change-management]] [[management]] 
- To change someone’s behavior, you’ve got to change that person’s situation. ([Location 92](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=92))
    - Tags: [[change-management]] 
- Remember that if you reach your colleagues’ Riders but not their Elephants, they will have direction without motivation. ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=236))

- What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. ([Location 248](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=248))
- Direct the Rider. What looks like resistance is often a lack of clarity. So provide crystal-clear direction. ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=283))
- Motivate the Elephant. What looks like laziness is often exhaustion. The Rider can’t get his way by force for very long. So it’s critical that you engage people’s emotional side—get their Elephants on the path and cooperative. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B005TKD512&location=284))

- Shape the Path. What looks like a people problem is often a situation problem. We call the situation (including the surrounding environment) the “Path.” When you shape the Path, you make change more likely, no matter what’s happening with the Rider and Elephant.
