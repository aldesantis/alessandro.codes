summary: |
  Walmart is seen as the only viable competitor to Amazon in the e-commerce market due to its substantial growth in recent years, crossing $100 billion in global online sales. While Amazon dominates with a 40% market share, Walmart's growth trajectory suggests it is becoming a stronger alternative. Other platforms like eBay and Shopify have their niches but lack the scale and broad appeal of Walmart and Amazon. Walmart's success challenges Amazon and encourages more investment in the e-commerce sector, ultimately benefitting both sellers and consumers.
