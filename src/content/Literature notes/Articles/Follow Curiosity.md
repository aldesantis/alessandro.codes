- Summary: I find an idea that was interesting. I would try to figure out that idea for myself, and then I’d figure out for myself, and I’d say, well, then I got to share this with other people.

## Highlights
- Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what’s worth paying attention to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw31vgvvyna39g7vm0zvgx9y))
- You can’t connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect them looking backwards. So, you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path.

- To yell at your creativity, saying, ‘You must earn money for me!’ is sort of like yelling at a cat; it has no idea what you’re talking about, and all you’re doing is scaring it away. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hw31z72bqbyenaqqe4psg0jt))
