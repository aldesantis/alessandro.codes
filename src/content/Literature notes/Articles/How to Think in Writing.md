  Writing helps refine thinking by making ideas more precise and complete. Without writing, one may not fully form or realize the limitations of their ideas. By unfolding and probing claims through writing, one can discover flaws, refine understanding, and reach deeper insights.

## Highlights
- When I sit down to write, the meadow is still sunk in darkness, and above it, satellites pass by, one after the other. My thoughts are flighty and shapeless; they morph as I approach them. But when I type, it is as if I pin my thoughts to the table. I can examine them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5hvm2mc0xwvv72hzj75ppkg))
- As I type, I’m often in a fluid mode—writing at the speed of thought. I feel confident about what I’m saying. But as soon as I stop, the thoughts solidify, rigid on the page, and, as I read what I’ve written, I see cracks spreading through my ideas. What seemed right in my head fell to pieces on the page.

- When I write, I push myself to make definite positive claims. Ambiguity allows thought to remain fluid on the page, floating into a different meaning when put under pressure. This makes it harder to push your thinking deeper. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5hvqtrmfg4es4v9g8ggrne0))
- Once I unfold my understanding in writing, I often see holes right away. I start correcting myself and discarding ideas already while typing. I cut ideas that are obviously flawed. I rewrite what feels ambiguous to make it sharper–more precise, concrete, unhedged, and true to my understanding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5hvxeqxxr9seqz6k1zfe2x5))
