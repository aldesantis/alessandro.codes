## Highlights
- A separate HBR [piece](https://hbr.org/2014/01/three-long-held-concepts-every-marketer-should-rethink) noted how the historical purpose of brand was to parse out large swaths of product quality and usefulness. But that role would erode as the Internet served that information directly to us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdpwjb46p8trcsn2jmx9dzpg))
- As brands get too heavy, they dominate the conversation and their weight dictates the narrative. This can lead to monopolies, unfair competition, waste and glut. The toxic side of capitalism. Business aside, big brands play into a monoculture where we consume, watch, and listen to the same things. Personally, I appreciate the individualism and creative expression that comes with niche splintering. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdpwn25eyc2zq1fkrjcmdqpe))
- Consumers, whether conscious of it or not, track with brands because they are following a person’s life. It doesn’t matter if the founder is visible, the staff is public, or there’s a celebrity face guiding the persona. Effective brands emote, communicate, and entertain in the theater of consumerism. Products are a vessel of that experience, a souvenir you take home from the gift shop. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jdpwnt2w2mbxfqs26jesnp2k))
