  Acquiring customers is increasingly challenging for direct-to-consumer (DTC) startups, leading to a focus on customer retention. While many startups highlight customer retention rates as a positive indicator, there are discussions about the limitations of using churn rate as a metric for retention. Research suggests that looking at purchasing trends by customer cohort may provide a more accurate measure of customer loyalty and brand health over time. It's important for DTC brands to understand the complexities of customer behavior and acquisition strategies to effectively assess and improve retention rates.

## Highlights
- a new academic [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4722115) indicates that there are drawbacks to one of the most common metrics that DTC brands use to measure retention. In essence, the paper claims that churn rate — or, the percentage of customers lost over a given period of time — is a misleading way to measure retention. And, that looking at purchasing trends by customer cohort is a better way to measure the health of a brand’s customer base.

- One metric he suggests companies instead look at is time-bound retention rate. With a time-bound retention rate, a company picks a certain point in time after a cohort was acquired– say, three months, six months, or 12 months — and use that as the basis of analysis, to look at data that’s not skewed by customers who churned early.
