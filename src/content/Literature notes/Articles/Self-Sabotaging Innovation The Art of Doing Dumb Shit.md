## Highlights
- [Action Bias](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/action-bias) leads us to believe that doing something – *anything* – is better than doing *nothing*, even when the action doesn’t actually move us forward. We equate busyness with productivity, mistaking motion for progress, and perceive novelty as innately valuable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfsq9t2yrjt9b5xn5hwmqncr))
- The brain doesn’t exist to help us think.
  It exists to save resources, helping us to *not think*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfsqa44jka17hsvv4pqg6xwf))
- We do things not because they work, but because everyone else is doing “it.”
  And when everyone else is doing “it,” those decisions evolve into "best practices."
  But!
  Frequency ≠ Norm ≠ Success
  In fact, it’s likely the *opposite*:
  Infrequency ≈ Abnormal ≈ Success ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfsqc0eqxx05ps7p4t8zxpbr))
- Why are we doing this?Who is this for?Does this matter to them?
  Too often, our drive for innovation is hollow — it’s about ticking boxes, posturing to an industry, and not being left behind. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfsqdmqmq5p38ftssy22twtt))
- Play dumb. Require over-simplification in the recommendation. Request or provide a super basic answer to help strip jargon and complexity. If it doesn’t make sense to a five year old, it won’t ever make sense. Make *them* realize *they* don’t make sense. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfsqegnx387echj9rffg4ez7))
- Give yourself two weeks and it will always take two weeks. Give yourself two days and it will take two days. If the Ancient Romans could decide the fate of empires in meetings which lasted no longer than the burning of a candle, surely we can discuss the team’s agenda in under an hour. Purposefully limiting time, curbs over-complexity and bureaucracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfsqef49kg10rpnpf5t0szpv))
- Ask yourself, “Do I believe in the shit I’m selling?” If not, get back to work until you do. We spend too much time *pretending* to care. We have to attempt to answer one of the most difficult questions, “Why is what you do important?” Let’s either work to find that answer, or work to change the output until that answer becomes clear.
