## Highlights
- Whenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll get exponential growth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he02mrwfyqvdq9qkdkjrzsrc))

- work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.

- always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he02rrc8cam5axhgjy3j2byt))
- don't overoptimize *what* you're learning. Don't limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he02rzb6vj2g9xfzy5c1zr52))
- Choose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he02y6m5t014syjs1z0nn1jw))

- Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he02z2t1fkm82y146jqjp8q3))

- If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01he030wzx6tbbtztnaxv419ax))
