## Highlights
- In the US, the market size of department stores as defined by retail value has shrunk by more than 40 percent between 2016 and 2021, according to Euromonitor. In Europe, that decline is more tempered. Over the same period, department stores’ sales diminished by 27 percent in Western Europe and 12.5 percent in Eastern Europe.

- European multi-brand chains are often anchored in tourist capitals, where visitors from Asia, the Middle East and increasingly the US stock up on [tax-free](https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/luxury/uk-luxury-brands-urge-government-to-bring-back-tax-free-shopping/) luxury merchandise. They also have a stronger heritage in the space — Le Bon Marché was the world’s very first department store when it opened in 1852 — as well as consumers who are less discount-driven than in the US. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgk6scgbsanwz2wtp199txhd))
- European department stores are also mostly privately owned, with ultra-wealthy owners who have been able to keep up investment during downturns in a way publicly traded US players could not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgk6v05bv631b4k2k4av63v1))
- As a result, the European stores exude a more creative and inviting atmosphere for consumers. Rather than vast, open layouts, they are partitioned into rooms or shop-in-shops with varying styles, contrasting open spaces and high ceilings with little corridors where shoppers can stumble upon things and explore. Variation is key: differences in lighting, openness of space, store furniture and the art that adorn the walls. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgk6wtyv0dkhz4hw174bk1jv))
- American department stores are increasingly invoking the European model where they can. Luxury brands like Chanel, for instance, have pushed their American wholesale partners to embrace the concessions model, the common way of operating multi-brand retail in Europe.

- For customers, the brand-operated shop-in-shop is often a more engaging experience, with brand-employed sales associates who are experts on the products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgk6zsp1fb6zg3e6k1edtda6))
- The missing piece of the puzzle is the cumulative effect of a multitude of products, experiences and services that helps reach different customers and create the consummate shopping experience. Initiatives often work best when executed with the aim of surprising and delighting the customer — creating a connection or exceeding their expectations — rather than simply making a sale.
