summary: |
  The author argues that the concept of "maximizing expected value" is often misleading and not the best way to make decisions. He suggests that common biases, like loss aversion, should not be dismissed as fallacies, as they can be rational responses to risk. Instead of blindly following buzzwords, individuals should think critically and adapt their strategies based on their unique situations.

## Highlights
- It took a lifetime of [pain](https://longform.asmartbear.com/startups-emotionally-draining/) and [sacrifice](https://longform.asmartbear.com/sacrifice-your-health-for-your-startup/) and [luck](https://longform.asmartbear.com/lucky/) to accumulate what you have. It is not irrational to be much more protective of losing it than you are greedy about getting more. Especially if the loss is catastrophic, as opposed to an experiment with 1/1000th of your money where the maximum loss is immaterial.

- Sometimes we pretend we’re so smart in avoiding so-called “sunk cost fallacy,” when really we’re justifying bailing out when times got tough. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcx6j5bm9xj61qzzdqz127f9))
- Overconfidence is not the same as being blind. Being confident in the vision, but skeptical about every detail, is how you find the truth. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcx6kqw1r7cabs2k150yj04a))
- You know, back when humans were living in Statistics for Economists class in college, it made sense for us to pretend that the real world was an idealized environment with only two variables, no complex dynamics, and perfectly rational actors. This worked because we were just trying not to get eaten by a pedantic professor.
  But, in our modern society, this is a fallacy! That’s why you have to use ideas and tools that make sense for each individual in their circumstances, thinking for yourself instead of parroting phrases off the internet you don’t really understand, running your own experiments instead of believing models and theories with more exceptions than examples, to transcend your lizard brain and be enlightened and strategic.
