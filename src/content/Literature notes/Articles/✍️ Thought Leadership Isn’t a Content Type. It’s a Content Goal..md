- Summary: I have been that person sitting in the room staring back at the eyes staring at me, expecting me to come up with a genius piece of content right now that can support the untested theory the company wants to solidify in the minds of its audience.

## Highlights
- Never has one single piece of content made anyone think of any organization as a thought leader in their space.

- What earns someone your trust is a [pattern of deserving it](https://link.workweek.com/click/35301445.7043/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2FtYnJpZGdlLm9yZy9jb3JlL2Jvb2tzL2Ficy90cnVzdC1pbi1tZWRpY2luZS9wYXR0ZXJuYmFzZWQtZGVmaW5pdGlvbi1vZi10cnVzdC9EQkQ3MEQwNDcxRTI5RERFRjUxMzUyQjNFRjNERDJBRD9oYXNoZWRfdXNlcj0wYTMwZWVjNzlkYWEyMzg2M2VhYTEwYTc2YWIwZGY4Mw/65fff68c6ede8b0b7709ef2eBdbea23fc), which means that over time, you come to learn––subconsciously or otherwise––who that person is, what they believe in, and why they care about the things they do.
  You learn this through their behavior overtime, and come to trust them based on their consistency. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxh44fpexmn3jw4w72z7k7tj))
