## Highlights
- (Only strong people are safe people, the measure of strength being not the absence of vulnerability — and “weakness” is just a judgment term for vulnerability — but the ability to carry one’s vulnerability with such self-awareness and valor so as not to harm other lives.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je197b3jdw12ab2x1845m4kh))
- Joy is not a function of a life free of friction and frustration, but a function of focus — an inner elevation by the fulcrum of choice. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je19ffztrgghgydp4m4ts87g))
- Forgiveness is the alchemy by which the shame transforms into the honor and privilege of being invited into another’s darkness and having them witness your own with the undimmed light of love, of sympathy, of nonjudgmental understanding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je19gr5wxf0h8728hfz8zs7p))
- **Question your maps and models of the universe, both inner and outer, and continually test them against the raw input of reality**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je19j7bnnqgwk5gx14tn9x6w))
- . Like all forms of destruction, cynicism is infinitely easier and lazier than construction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je19krr40t3g91svyv2h995z))
- Supply creates its own demand. Only by consistently supplying it can we hope to increase the demand for the substantive over the superficial — in our individual lives and in the collective dream called culture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je19mr3qsrjcpnn8xm6qf854))
- Who are the people, ideas, and books that magnify your spirit? Find them, hold on to them, and visit them often. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je19nbp84m6344tyb6ach59z))
- The flower doesn’t go from bud to blossom in one spritely burst and yet, as a culture, we’re disinterested in the tedium of the blossom*ing*. But that’s where all the real magic unfolds in the making of one’s character and destiny. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je19p1w8xx2pc4hka2ckhdhj))
- The best ideas come to us when we stop actively trying to coax the muse into manifesting and let the fragments of experience float around our unconscious mind in order to click into new combinations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01je19qcybm3hc2wnrcteq0ts7))
