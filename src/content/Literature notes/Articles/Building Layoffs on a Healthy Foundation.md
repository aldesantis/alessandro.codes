## Highlights
- The first and most important motivation for secrecy is during the planning phase you don’t know the details sufficiently to answer anyone’s questions.

Having opinions about these things before you’re in right in the middle of a layoff will make planning much smoother. It also means that you can examine whether your ratios are the right ones as part of the layoff planning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1ydchb9dbns541nchet5vv7))
- Layoffs should not be used as a substitute for actively managing out folks who aren’t working out. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1ydfba83my3z2b8dzqzkmbx))
- Relatedly make sure your most important folks know they’re important, feel appreciated and are excited about the future before you’re in the middle of navigating the delicate balance of being excited about the future while respectful of the people who are leaving.
