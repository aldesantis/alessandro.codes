summary: |
  In this article, the author discusses the concept of technopoly and the need to dismantle it. They reflect on their own experience of criticizing social media and the backlash they faced. The author references Neil Postman's book "Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology," which argues that we now live in a technopoly, where innovation and efficiency are prioritized over traditional values. However, the author highlights that cracks in technopoly are starting to appear, with increasing skepticism and resistance to certain technologies. They propose a perspective called techno-selectionism, which acknowledges the potential benefits of technology while also recognizing the need to reject harmful innovations.

## Highlights
- Technopoly eliminates alternatives to itself in precisely the way Aldous Huxley outlined in Brave New World,” Postman writes. “It does not make them illegal. It does not make them immoral. It does not even make them unpopular. It makes them invisible and therefore irrelevant. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjr9s2kedk5qtc62qh61fa1e))
- Techno-selectionists believe that we should continue to encourage and reward people who experiment with what comes next. But they also know that some experiments end up causing more bad than good.
