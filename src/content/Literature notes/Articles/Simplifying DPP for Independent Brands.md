## Highlights
- Instead, sustainability efforts should focus on nailing the product, material and asset level data. Leveraging transparency as a competitive advantage by making consumers feel good and informed about their purchases. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9pymq2kgfb0zkgy2jsqhc41))
- Setting aside the bigger ethical imperative of sustainability, there is a clear opportunity for brands to leverage transparency as a competitive advantage pre-purchase. And the threat of DPP legislation may just be the kick up the a**e brands need to start doing the right thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9pyrz4c02xjy4ka3s47c0gy))
    - Tags: [[retail]] [[esg]] [[dpps]] 
- A lot of noise surrounding event level tracking within DPP blends into broader discussions around the concept of *circularity.* The notion of event level tracking through a products entire lifespan simply aren’t in the realms of possibility (yet) and feels unlikely to ever happen. To expect consumers to add data, or even a resale or recycling partner with the millions of garments they receive, just doesn’t seem fathomable.
