- Summary: Your sister-in-law loves music. Her birthday is approaching and you decide to get her a vinyl player.

## Highlights
- Refrain from focusing on making products prettier to market them to women (e.g. more stylish sneakers over comfortable ones). In reality, women are likely to prefer functionality over design.
  This is especially important if creating a beautiful product comes at the cost of quality loss. Visually attractive but not functional products will likely hurt your sales. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hkqe175sxdeccjfsgapsjj7w))
