summary: |
  Walmart's strategic move to acquire Vizio, a smart TV brand, for $2.3 billion is primarily focused on bolstering its advertising business. With the acquisition, Walmart gains access to valuable digital real estate in millions of American households through Vizio's home screens, providing control over ad inventory supporting over a billion hours of free streaming video monthly. The deal, if approved, allows Walmart to integrate Vizio into its expanding digital advertising business, which saw a 28% growth last year to $3.4 billion, aligning with the trend of retail media networks becoming increasingly lucrative in the past decade.

## Highlights
- Retail media networks have become particularly lucrative over the past decade, mostly for two reasons:
  (1) Because they’re as close to the bottom of the marketing funnel as possible — people are literally making the purchase on the same website. And they can track it and confidently take credit for the sale, proving direct return on investment.
  (2) Because retailers can basically force brands to spend a meaningful portion of their sales on advertising, by controlling the design of their websites and apps. Want to show up anywhere near the top of search results? Want people to see you before your competition? Better buy ads! It’s all but impossible to sell at these stores without being an advertiser.

    - Note: To an extent, RMNs turn retail into a pay-to-play game. However, the same can be said of any other form of advertising: it becomes a situation where, if you're not advertising, you're effectively not in the game.
