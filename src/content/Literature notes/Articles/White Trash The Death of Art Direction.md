summary: |
  Fashion campaigns are losing their creativity, shifting from vibrant, unique visuals to bland, minimalistic designs. This change has led to a decline in the role of art directors, who are now often sidelined in favor of profit-driven strategies. As a result, consumers are left with unremarkable content that lacks the artistry and storytelling once inherent in luxury fashion advertising.

## Highlights
- What’s left is an oversaturated market for camera-wielding creatives who confidently achieve very *mid* image making, but there are far, far less who can push beyond that and deliver something *premium*, something that surprises the client (or even the customer), and which is just undeniably special.
