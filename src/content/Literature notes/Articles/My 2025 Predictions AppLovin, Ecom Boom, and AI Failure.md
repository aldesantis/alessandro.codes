- Summary: Disclosure: Because of the beliefs shared below I’ve decided to invest in AppLovin before writing this article. This isn’t financial or business advice.

## Highlights
- AppLovin will eat all of DTC’s advertising budget that doesn’t go to Meta.
  • The desire to be less dependent on Meta is REAL.
  • TikTok is banned.
  • Reddit is popular but has the same targeting difficulties as YouTube.
  • Google is extracting cash while battling ChatGPT.
  • No one has nailed prospecting on Direct Mail.
  • TV requires too much creative work to launch.
  The ecosystem is ripe for a new channel, and AppLovin is giving me Meta 2016 vibes:
  • Bad ad buying platform with limited inventory
  • Most serious advertisers don’t take it seriously
  • Immense scale + crazy active user base. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgbkn4snvz6n1jyejawke9a8))
- Fed interest rates are Banks/Financial institutions “COGS” equivalent. The lower their COGS are, the lower their standards will become to loan out money. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgbknqq9f4v4ys5mff15y10v))
