## Highlights
- *Expand the Size of Addressable Market.* Brands build awareness for a company beyond its target audience, hopefully propelling it in the domain of culture and increasing its chances to be part of the consumers’ initial consideration set. Through its brand promise and brand values, a company can reach customers who ordinarily wouldn’t consider its products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6reea409k7tc1f332f9e4x1))
- *Provide long-term differentiation*. Brands increase product value by adding emotional resonance and symbolic dimension to it. Consumers are not buying products, they are buying stories. Once they buy into a point of view, a set of values, and a lifestyle, consumers are less likely to treat a product as an interchangeable commodity, and more likely to be loyal to the brand.

    - Tags: [[retail]] [[marketing]] [[positioning]] 
- *Ensure Strategic Growth.* Brands clarify decision-making criteria. They guide new growth opportunities, product development, operations, and communication. Brands that evaluate whether a specific business action or investment move them closer to their vision move faster and more confidently than its peers.

- Against these two-track consumption pattern, there are the 4Cs of the modern brand: community, content, curation, and collaborations. The 4Cs shape how a brand creates social, cultural, environmental and economic value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6regynnvg8ftsh8z5rea40p))
    - Tags: [[retail]] [[ecommerce]] [[strategy]] [[branding]] [[favorite]] 
- *Curation.* Brands are embracing the role of taste curators and bringing forth their unique POV on everything from food to film and theater to architecture and pop culture. Making something part of a curated selection lets brands increase the price and the profit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h6rek56rfypg7n6e1qt5ak24))
    - Tags: [[curation]] [[branding]] [[positioning]] 
- A product like cookware or a plant is never just a cookware or a plant: it’s a conduit for creativity, community, aesthetic pleasure, or a way to minimize environmental impact. When they buy a plate or a dress, consumers signal a lifestyle. When they sell a plate or a dress, sellers signal their worldview. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj3ksrr4s8z5db2zkfg956j8))
- A two-track consumption pattern emerged: a) mass consumption of standardized products, and b) considered consumption of signaling products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hj3kt8t45q9qxtnbxmcynkm9))
- Across categories, brands are pivoting to lifestyle, often livestreamed, content en masse. While it may feel overwhelming at times, this lifestyle content pivot is a good thing: it moves the brands away from product marketing and forces them to explore, define, and capitalize on their cultural and social role.
