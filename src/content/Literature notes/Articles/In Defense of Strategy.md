## Highlights
- **companies that are the best at execution are precisely the ones for which strategy is most important**. They’re the only ones that have a shot.
  The better you are at execution, the faster you can run in *any* direction. A good strategy helps you run fast in the *right* direction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h83zjectjva39rmrbm1tzsx6))

- That doesn’t mean that strategy is more important for big companies than for startups. The opposite is true: **strategy is highest-leverage at Day 0**, when all paths are available. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h83zmdbky69j223dykmqazdr))
- If you use the uncertainty window to execute blindly for a while *before* crafting a strategy, you’ve both wasted precious uncertainty time *and* made decisions – hired people, signed customers, taken on outside capital – that will make it harder to change direction when you decide you must.

- **Failure to Face the Challenge**: There’s often one key thing that really matters for a business - Rumelt calls it the *[Crux](https://www.amazon.com/Crux-How-Leaders-Become-Strategists-ebook/dp/B09G2QXXWX)* in a new book – but bad strategy dances around it in favor of a bunch of things that matter less but are easier to deal with or measure.

- A strategy is a high-level plan to achieve one or more goals under conditions of uncertainty, designed through recognizing the challenge (diagnosis), setting a direction to overcome it (guiding policy), and detailing steps to implement the policy (coherent actions). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h83zqqqpqc8mfjd2xq9rjv01))
- A rough way of thinking about *what* should change is that the diagnosis should be the most stable, the guiding policy should be relatively stable, and the coherent actions should be the quickest to adapt to new information. Let’s take each in turn. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h83zsa6b2cyqk4j0kjpypk5k))
- **Finally, if the founders see a path to defensibility, they need to determine the one or two most important challenges to address head-on.**
  Based on your diagnosis, what is the most critical solvable problem facing your company? Identify that upfront, and craft your strategy around solving it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8400nbwycxk0e5qmbbwc243))
- Good strategy can actually free startups up to move *faster* by making it clear exactly what the company wants to do, and for whom, and giving autonomy to the talented people it hires by letting them select their own **coherent actions** that fit within the strategy. A clear strategy from the top allows more independent decision-making at all levels. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h8405an37dsx5dytme7xpjjx))
- Strategy comes down to choices. The first choice is whether or not to have a strategy. Founders can bet on brute force execution alone. Or pair execution with strategy to tilt the odds.
  When uncertainty looms, strategy lets you see the path before competitors do. It might just give you the time you need to succeed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h840e9rge0hry5xtgt34y3nn))
