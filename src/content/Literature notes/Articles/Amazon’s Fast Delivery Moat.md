## Highlights
- Amazon’s bet is that faster shipping is behavior-changing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyh36ttj0v7wpmtv0n6pwq68))
- Fast delivery is not a linear improvement; the difference between two-day and same-day is structural for the retailer and behavior-changing for the shopper. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyh37f1f2rbj1m3aksnmf7z8))
- Amazon doesn’t sell goods. It sells goods that ship in one to two days and, for some shoppers, same-day. [The logistics are as much part of the product as the products themselves.](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/amazon-sells-fast-shipping-not-products) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyh384jh028z5rta3s0b6vd0))
