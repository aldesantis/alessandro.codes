## Highlights
- The trouble is, as soon as you close your heart to one thing — to anything — you close your heart. It doesn’t work in increments. As soon as I begin to say no and pull away, there is a contraction, and that contraction closes me off. So I have to ask the question: do I want be open, or closed? Then I have to follow through. I have to acknowledge that to say ‘no’ to the cloud means also saying no to the tight fists of the peonies next to me too.
