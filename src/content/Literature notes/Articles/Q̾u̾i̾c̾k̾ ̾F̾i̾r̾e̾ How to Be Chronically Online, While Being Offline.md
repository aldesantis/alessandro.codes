## Highlights
- In a world increasingly plagued by feed fatigue, the battle to stand out on social media has become often devoid of any real meaning.

- rather than observing and following online trends, brands are fully capable of creating their own, treating social media culture as its peer and equal, rather than a source of culture-mining. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgbnxdmwhpeyrn11yjdbp3bg))

And to be brand brutalist, with core values that stay holy and creative expression that invites true blasphemy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgbny12a10j8a11nsk631756))
