## Highlights
- unless you’re a brand like Kate Spade or Crocs, you don’t need to spend your dollars on Awareness or Website Clicks campaigns. Everything should be a conversion campaign. What changes is the Conversion Event that you optimize toward. If you’re looking for purchases, you optimize for Purchases. If you’re looking to fill your funnel, you optimize for Add To Cart. If you’re looking for site traffic, you optimize for View Content. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hc9wcb0qvfb6zfc0rhwy89w4))
