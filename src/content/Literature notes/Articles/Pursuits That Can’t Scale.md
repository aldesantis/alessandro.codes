## Highlights
- I can’t help but notice though that after a successful stint at building things that do scale (or at least giving it a really good, long try), many people seem to gravitate towards building things that don’t scale.
  I have a theory that *chasing things that scale* makes you need therapy, and the therapy is *pursuing things that can’t scale*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g64rmshfk255wgjwzh3rr2))
- I think another driver of this sentiment and behavior is that chasing scale strips you of some humanity. It puts your head too high up in the clouds. It removes you from what happens in the real world with real people. *Pursuing something that can’t scale does the exact opposite: it grounds you.* It’s a comforting and healing next act.
