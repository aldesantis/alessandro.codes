summary: |
  Workshops can serve as portals to gain insight into a client's organization and create clarity for long-term retained work. By selling workshops as a small piece of work, consultants can bypass contract negotiation and dive into the client's reality. These workshops should be collaborative and focused on conversation prompts that drive towards clarity and understanding. The goal is to establish a personal relationship with the client, gain a deeper understanding of their context and problems, and create a foundation for solving those problems. Additionally, workshops can simplify the process of negotiating a scope of work and pricing for ongoing retainers. It is important for consultants to value their expertise and charge appropriately for these workshops.

## Highlights
- Invariably, the lived experience feels more like a jam session than a guided workshop. Free jazz not pop. Experience not performance. Collaborative not guided. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr9hp5vhk2jeb8vnh4vbnb2n))
- And typically I restrict these sessions to no more than 5-6 people - beyond that it’s hard to hear the individual voices and people start to put on masks and behave differently around each other. **If you want the truth, keep the group small.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr9hpz4ye9jv615y5cbt6apd))
- • Don’t be afraid to “solve” small problems in the room - especially those where you have some domain expertise and the credibility for people to trust your answer.
  • **DO be afraid to solve big problems in the room**. Even if you think you have a clear solution… you don’t. At best you come up with a “solution” that could work in theory, but fails to get sold in and implemented or is too generic and actually misses some context.. At worst, your “solution” is no solution at all, is a failed solution they have already rejected, or gets taken forward as an apparent solution that falls apart later.

- **You can get away with a much lighter SOW (statement of work) after a good workshop**
  I’ve heard from other indie consultants and freelancers that sometimes putting together a scope or SOW and getting it approved by the client is a real point of pain - even once you’re aligned on the project and scope!
  The negotiation is hard when you’re lacking trust and context and both parties are trying to anticipate what kinds of work and what level of detail is needed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr9htz04sqs15nkyjxwng7eh))
