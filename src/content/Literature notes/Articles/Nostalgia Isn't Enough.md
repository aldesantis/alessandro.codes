## Highlights
- Nostalgia works only as a first step in the brand revival. It is a short-term tactic to remind and delight, and after it, a brand needs to move on. Otherwise, a brand is in danger of getting stuck in a its glory days while the world, culture, and consumers all moved on. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgdx5j0x884nvtek1x39jdr1))
- Instead of originality, thereâ€™s curation. By curating (not replicating) the old, brands give it renewed meaning in consumers eyes: curation contextualizes items within a current time and a point of view. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hgdx82bzjtsmqc4yb1emqr3x))
