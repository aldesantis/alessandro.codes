## Highlights
- conducting user research is systematic inquiry and can be broken down into three areas: thinking of a question, gathering evidence, and considering what it means.
- Broadly-speaking, the aim of generative research is to pinpoint a problem statement, identify the problem to be solved, and collect enough data to move forward.

- Evaluative research focuses on evaluating a product or concept in order to collect data that will improve the solution.

- Quantitative research comes from data and statistics, and results in numerical data. Its goal is to identify patterns, make predictions, and generalize findings about a target audience or topic.
- Qualitative research comes from comments, opinions and observations, and is used to yield an understanding of the motivations, thoughts and attitudes of target users.
