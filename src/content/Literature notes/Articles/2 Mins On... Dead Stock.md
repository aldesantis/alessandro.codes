- Summary: Unchecked, dead stock can be the silent killer of an otherwise successful business because it hammers profitability and ties up working capital.

- Identify dead stock early and have a plan of attack of how to deal with it. Combine data with human input here - let the data tell you *how* dead something is, let a person decide how to deal with it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrcq8chft9z27hxd9zrhrw2q))
