- Summary: The article discusses various thought exercises that businesses can use to come up with fresh and transformative ideas. These include considering extreme hypothetical scenarios such as increasing prices by 10x or losing all customers, finding ways to maximize fun and creativity in product development, and shaking up business models. The article also suggests thinking outside the box, even if it means considering drastic actions such as terminating a product line or pivoting the entire company.

## Highlights
- All your good ideas will be copied; it’s just a question of when. Competing only on features results in bullet-point battles; this is the weakest way to win sales. Creating bigger and more emotional distinction is a powerful way to win, and breaks us of the habit of believing that incremental product updates will dramatically increase differentiation, or growth.

- Business models force you into certain frames of thinking about how to monetize value that you create, and how costs need to scale with sales and infrastructure. The general idea for any company is to generate far more value than it charges for, so customers are genuinely better off in the exchange, and are happy to be long-term customers. Shaking up the business model shakes up the value/cost equation; sometimes a different business model is actually better for everyone.

- *Sometimes you interview customers and come away with the wrong feature ideas anyway. Sometimes you ask them whether they’d use something, and they say yes, and they even meant it, but after spending five months building it, they don’t actually use it. Stretching your ability to get empirical signal helps you avoid those issues, and might even create breakthrough ideas, or avoid ideas that seem great, but aren’t.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr9gjzqg1cfp2ga8my4e6tq6))
- You never want to contemplate catastrophic actions like layoffs, whole-company pivots, terminating an entire product line, and for good reason—the consequences are dire, arguably even inhumane. At the same time, that aversion prevents you from thinking certain thoughts. You should at least be able to explore the thoughts. The very best ideas should not be avoided only because they are hard.

- What externality has the potential to kill the entire company?
  Is there a company X, which released product Y, at price Z, that would reduce your new sales to a trickle, and would mean half your customers leave within a year? Can you think of a security breech so significant, most of the customer base leaves within a year? How could the economy change, in which no one would buy your software?
  Now, is there something you could do to mitigate that effect? Or something that pivots the company such that it is no longer a threat? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hr9gna35phx5dgt1h0c07t6h))
