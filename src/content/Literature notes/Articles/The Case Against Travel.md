summary: |
  The Case Against Travel argues that tourism is ultimately self-defeating, as it turns travelers into mere spectators and diverts them from authentic sensory experiences and human connections. The article notes that tourism is driven more by the needs of the producer than the consumer and is marked by its locomotive character. The author concludes that traveling is ultimately a delusion that turns individuals into the worst version of themselves, while convincing them that they are at their best.

## Highlights
- Tourists are less likely to borrow from their hosts than their hosts are from them, thus precipitating a chain of change in the host community.” We go to experience a change, but end up inflicting change on others. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv78kh3ttfqef66rjxww8sd))

- Tourism is marked by its locomotive character. “I went to France.” O.K., but what did you do there? “I went to the Louvre.” O.K., but what did you do there? “I went to see the ‘Mona Lisa.’ ” That is, before quickly moving on: apparently, many people spend just fifteen seconds looking at the “Mona Lisa.” It’s locomotion all the way down.

- During my Paris wanderings, I would stare at people, intently inspecting their clothing, their demeanor, their interactions. I was trying to see the Frenchness in the French people around me. This is not a way to make friends. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv7fnrwxv375nzrswsj82ec))

- The traveller departs confident that she will come back with the same basic interests, political beliefs, and living arrangements. Travel is a boomerang. It drops you right where you started. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv7hry5xdr8d3w2adtgn3ja))
- If you aren’t planning a major life change, the prospect looms, terrifyingly, as “More and more of this, and then I die.” Travel splits this expanse of time into the chunk that happens before the trip, and the chunk that happens after it, obscuring from view the certainty of annihilation.
