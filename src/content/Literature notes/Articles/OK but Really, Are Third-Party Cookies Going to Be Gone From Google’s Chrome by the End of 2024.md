summary: |
  The timeline for the phase-out of third-party cookies in Google Chrome has become uncertain, with some ad executives predicting that they will still be present in the first quarter of 2025. The UK's Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) has raised concerns about Google's Privacy Sandbox, which is meant to serve as an alternative to third-party cookies. The CMA believes the Sandbox falls short in supporting ad tech use cases and lacks interoperability, potentially leading to a shift of ad budgets to platforms with extensive access to first-party data. The CMA's report highlights regulatory concerns and calls for additional feedback before decisions are made.

## Highlights
- Among these concerns is that the Sandbox seems to fall short in supporting all current ad tech use cases and business practices. It may also lack the interoperability seen in solutions relying on third-party cookies. This could lead to advertisers shifting their budgets away from the open display market and into the “walled gardens” owned by giants like Google, Meta or Amazon, all with extensive access to first-party data.
