- Summary: The Feynman Technique is the best way to supercharge your learning. And it works no matter the subject.

## Highlights
- "I think we talk about discipline because it feels tough to do. We’re doing the hard thing. We’re slogging through. But when we are at our best, we’re not slogging through. Great people are obsessed and they’re not slogging through. They are driven. They are motivated. They are deeply, deeply engaged. ... If it starts to feel like a slog and you’re pushing yourself every day—I mean, we all have periods of that—but [do it] too long and that really becomes laborious. To me, it’s often a flag that perhaps you shouldn’t be in that area at all." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hf6vtvv35thshp2gtqwg7w60))
