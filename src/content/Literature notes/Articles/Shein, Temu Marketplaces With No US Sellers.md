summary: |
  Shein and Temu are rapidly growing e-commerce marketplaces in the U.S., but they have no U.S. sellers. Shein's marketplace was intended to attract U.S. sellers and localize the business, but almost all of the sellers are based in China. Temu, on the other hand, initially planned to add U.S. sellers but has not found enough local sellers that meet their requirements. Both marketplaces operate at a large scale and have significant marketing budgets, but their lack of U.S. sellers may limit their potential for growth in the long term.

## Highlights
- Shein and Temu are unlike anything U.S. commerce had seen before, the [third iteration of Chinese commerce](https://www.marketplacepulse.com/articles/made-sold-and-marketed-by-china). They are retailers from China that only sell outside of China, operate at a scale of tens of billions of dollars, spend so much on marketing to be noticed by other retailers and ad networks like Facebook, and run marketplaces with no U.S. sellers or brands. Their attempts to localize are long-term bets that today are closer to an exercise in smoke and mirrors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv81m29axe24fd422tda1hm))
