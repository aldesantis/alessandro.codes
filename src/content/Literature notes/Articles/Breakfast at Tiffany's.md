## Highlights
- Veblen writes, “In order to gain and to hold the esteem of men it is not sufficient merely to possess wealth or power. The wealth or power must be put in evidence, for esteem is awarded only on evidence” (*The Theory of the Leisure Class*, 1899).

- It’s important not to confuse these two terms: value is subjective, determined by a product’s importance to the consumer based on its necessity, shelf life, and quality, while cost is merely relative to average income and competing options.

- While lifetime value may remain strong, often tied to new product drops or seasonality, the lower price points lead to thinner margins and a higher percentage loss on product returns relative to net income. This makes scaling profitably much harder, limiting flexibility when testing trends or experimenting with advertising. Consequently, lower-value fashion is often better suited for B2B and retail models, rather than competing heavily on paid channels like Google or Facebook.
