## Highlights
- If a person does not already believe they have a problem, they will not be surfing the Internet looking for a solution, and even if they happen upon your website somehow, you cannot get them to spend money to solve a problem they don’t think they have.

- You can’t force a market. You can have an idea, and as a startup part of your job is to be ahead of it, and sometimes you’re right about that, and sometimes you’re not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1bhytaj48z1114yaqw9v90d))
    - Tags: [[marketing]] [[startups]] 
- A lot of great ideas, attacking real problems, fail to become successful companies, because the target market doesn’t know they’re even in the market. Because they’re not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1bj28hvke5hhszxhzr8p43z))
    - Tags: [[marketing]] [[startups]] [[product-management]] 
- Large companies have to allocate more than money—they have compliance teams who have to approve, they compare multiple vendors, they run pilot programs, and all of this won’t be set in motion unless it’s a top problem. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1bj5882vesye0dwfnez7vgm))
    - Tags: [[startups]] 
- A lot of great ideas, attacking real problems that customers acknowledge and seek solutions for, are in areas where budgets don’t exist, or not often, or are so small that it requires an enormous number of customers to make money (often also in a crowded competitive space), and therefore the company fails.

    - Tags: [[startups]] [[strategy]] [[marketing]] 
- When the customer is already paying to solve the problem, or actively comparing options to solve the problem, you still run into the barrier of whether they have the organizational will to buy from you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1bjbvc00c4etw3jt4degnns))

- The second hurdle is **differentiation**. This doesn’t just mean “you have something unique.” You might have a feature that no one else has, but if only 10% of the market cares about that feature, that’s not enough. Worse, your competitor will have some feature *you* don’t have, and what if 30% of the market cares about *that* one? This is a topic that requires another article for full treatment (which is forthcoming!). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1bje4z0y1e4ee801g1rbgcx))

- Trust can be side-stepped by building a type of product that doesn’t require much trust14. Or trust can be built by mitigation, for example open-source means the customer can shift to another vendor or take over the code base in a worst-case scenario.

- In general, **targeting a niche often results in a better business model**, because although it reduces the number of target customers, it can increase several other numbers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1bjw5txp61pekha5qg21nyk))
