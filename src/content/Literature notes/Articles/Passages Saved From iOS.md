## Highlights
- You are A/B testing minor tweaks instead of sweeping changes to your landing pages. I promise you that the font you picked for your product page is not affecting sales. Those sorts of minuscule A/B tests are popular for brands with billions of pageviews, which I'd guess is not you. Instead, focus your A/B tests on dramatically different pages, changing messaging, layout, product images, pricing. These big tests will show you very quickly what your baseline conversion behavior is.
