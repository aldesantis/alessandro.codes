## Highlights
- Modern aspiration is not about having money to buy things, but having taste to know what to buy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcf2v534kez15mjp84ytmz9n))
    - Tags: [[favorite]] [[retail]] [[culture]] [[luxury]] [[ecommerce]] 
- We trust curators because we believe that they spent time and effort in developing their expertise. This belief seeped from the art world into the aspirational economy, with the new breed of aspirants looking to share their taste and turn their social and cultural capital into the economic one. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcf2wzsv4e0veha6mrs8t781))
- The Row’s Instagram account is a careful selection of architecture, furniture, sculpture, and art, all of which convey an atmosphere. The idea is to present the Row’s clothes as just one expression of The Row’s rarified taste and point of view. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcf2ynfhr7qpv1nm5axpdy6x))
    - Tags: [[retail]] [[branding]] [[curation]] 
- For a brand, curation can retain an audience and attract the new one that hasn’t considered a brand before. It can attract a collaborator or start a brand partnership. It can increase product value and protect pricing. For an individual, curation can be a way to get into a creative profession or monetize their taste.

    - Tags: [[branding]] [[culture]] [[positioning]] [[retail]] [[marketing]] 
- Stories boost the relevance and significance of a product or a brand. They turn them into collectibles, lend them meaning and cultural purpose, and emphasize their social and communal dimension. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcf33w623zgfv9h7gavf4hmy))
    - Tags: [[culture]] [[marketing]] [[ecommerce]] [[branding]] 
- A good cultural narrative cannot take place just anywhere. A provenance like South of France, Lower East Side on Manhattan, Harajuku in Tokyo or Kreuzberg in Berlin are culture machines. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcf354s5rmn1hkh9qk9cf9y4))
