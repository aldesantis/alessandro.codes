  Breaking complex systems into smaller, manageable parts helps us understand and solve problems more effectively. This modular approach allows for flexibility, as components can be swapped or changed without disrupting the entire system. Drawing boundaries thoughtfully is crucial, as it shapes the system's behavior and influences how it can evolve over time.

## Highlights
- The behavior of a system is defined by the structure of its connections, be it ant trails, neurons, or circuits. So, modules shape behavior by changing the structure of the system.
  It matters where we draw the line. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jfqkpghjqtbaqv57qwtethez))
- In a functioning market, modular boundaries will begin to emerge by themselves. Interfaces will form around areas of certainty. They embody the commodity part of the problem. Modules contain the remaining uncertainty, and therefore [all of the alpha](https://reactionwheel.net/2019/11/startups-and-uncertainty.html).
