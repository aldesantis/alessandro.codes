summary: |
  Brand marketing has undergone significant shifts in recent years, moving towards cultural influence rather than just brand communications. These shifts include moving from top of the funnel to the entire funnel, from advertising to entertainment, and from promoting products to focusing on the overall look and styling. Brand marketing is now tasked with recognizing and participating in emerging fashion aesthetics and engaging with subcultures and niche communities. Additionally, brands are shifting from attention-grabbing promotions to making cultural noise, collaborating with creators and communities, and activating existing fans for word-of-mouth marketing. These changes require a new approach to brand strategy, focusing on cultural strategy and utilizing tactics such as partnerships, content creation, and merchandising.

## Highlights
- Brand marketing is often tasked mostly with promoting a seasonal brand collection. In a reversal of this process, brand marketing is tasked with recognizing and participating in the fashion aesthetics that are emerging in subcultures, niche communities, resale platforms and/or around pop culture events.

- For Gen Z, shopping is the top among their entertainment activities (above playing video games). Modern brands are in the business of entertainment, and in addition to seasonal campaigns, the job of brand marketing is to provide quirky and fun snippets of always-on content, merch and products, creative collaborations that introduce novelty, and to plan its seasonal campaigns as entertainment products, like movies: through teasers, trailers, opening nights, and launch.

- Traditionally, brand marketing was entrusted with promoting a company’s identity and values. By opening up interpretation of this identity and values, a brand ensures its own longevity and future: just like the most enduring cultural stories and sagas are those that are oral, transported from generation to generation, with community additions and embellishments, so the most enduring brand stories are those that are built with a community ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmby04m144hbchjg4h0xv3b6))
- Brand marketing is often tasked with touting product benefits in addition to brand storytelling. Product focus is today less important than all of the ways this product can be used, worn, and interacted with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hmby0gsqf398h1hjwc0gk1x7))
- As brand marketing moves to cover the entire funnel, its executions need to retain customers as much as they attract them. Merch and collaborations are the best way of doing this, as customers get immediately something tangible, enriched with the cultural capital. Merch and collaborations are immediately inserted into the cultural exchange system, which automatically retains customers through associations and symbolic value.

- Traditionally, brand marketing is focused on top of funnel actions and KPIs (awareness, interest, consideration). It overemphasizes “consider” and “buy” stages of the customer journey, with allocation of the most of media resources to building preference pre-purchase. The result is often deadlock in customer base. The new brand marketing focuses on the entire funnel, making “evaluate” and “advocate” stages more relevant through content, collaborations, merch, curation and creative partnerships.

- In addition to monetizable content, there is merch, special editions and capsules, archive reissues and sequels, awards recognizing an area of culture, collaborations outside a brand’s original product line, and hospitality properties, like cafes, restaurants, hotels and private experiences.
