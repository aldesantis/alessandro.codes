  In-game advertising companies are seeing the death of third-party cookies as an opportunity rather than a challenge. They believe that the collapse of cookies will result in a split online ad market, with high-quality ad inventory using first-party identifiers and consent, and a long tail of poorly targeted impressions that are more prone to fraud. In the gaming environment, every action a user takes generates data, allowing in-game advertising companies to gather valuable insights without relying on cookies. They can measure metrics such as brand lift and loyalty through in-game engagements. While the growth of in-game advertising may be gradual, it offers brands a unique way to connect with users.

## Highlights
- In a gaming environment, almost every action a user takes generates data, from the specific in-game decisions they make to the amount of time they dwell in any particular area, without ever having to rely on technology like third-party cookies. This allows in-game advertising companies to leverage game worlds as de facto user surveys measuring metrics such as brand lift and brand loyalty.
