- Category: #articles
- Summary: “Dasein” is a term used by philosopher Martin Heidegger to describe the unique way humans exist in the world. It emphasizes being engaged with our surroundings and understanding our individual existence. Heidegger contrasts authentic Dasein, which involves personal meaning, with inauthentic Dasein, where people lose their individuality by conforming to social norms.

## Highlights

- “**Dasein**” (German pronunciation: [[ˈdaːzaɪn]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German)) is a technical term in the philosophy of [Martin Heidegger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger). Adopted from the ordinary German word _Dasein_ meaning “existence”,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein#cite_note-2) Heidegger used it to refer to the mode of [being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being) that is particular to human beings. It is a form of being that is aware of and must confront such issues as [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person), [mortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death), and the dilemma or paradox of living in relationship with other humans while being ultimately alone with oneself.

- Heidegger sought to use the concept of Dasein to uncover the primal nature of “[Being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being)” (_Sein_), agreeing with Nietzsche and [Dilthey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Dilthey)[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein#cite_note-8): 48 that Dasein is always a being engaged in the world: neither a subject, nor the objective world alone, but the coherence of [being-in-the-world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being-in-the-world).

    - Note: This is similar to the concept of Quality explained in Zen and the rest of motorcycle maintenance.
