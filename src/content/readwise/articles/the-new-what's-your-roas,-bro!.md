## Highlights

- the way to analyze or determine whether your business is healthy or not, is by looking at the ratio between your CAC and your LTV. If your CAC is $50 and your LTV is $150, then your LTV:CAC is 3. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz0wtszbckxe177fsw5gwpt3))
- So you basically need to analyze; “What is my LTV:CAC by different cohorts, such as 3 months after purchase, 6 months after purchase, 9, 12, etc.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz0ww744c24hfmahdsj3ksps))

- if you have many SKUs (which we recommend you to have to increase your LTV in general), then you need to understand what your LTV per SKU is too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz0wwjk3k8vhecepe5mcd0e8))
- The way we think about it is: LTV consists of 4 components - which are:
  - Why should someone buy from you again, and why should they do it now?
  - Do YOU give THEM the ability to buy from you again (We’ll elaborate in a sec here)
  - How is the experience of buying from your brand?
  - What value do you add to your customers other than the product? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gz0wx5rvjk4cgcdpwbfm69ry))
