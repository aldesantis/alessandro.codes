- Summary: Life balance is not about dividing your time equally among different areas of your life but integrating them effectively. Instead of choosing between priorities, successful individuals find ways to combine them, leading to a fulfilling and integrated life. Integrating different aspects like work, relationships, and health can lead to a more rewarding and balanced lifestyle.

  - where you get paid for results, not for time-in-chair
  - where the best people get paid 10x or 100x more than the avg (this is almost everything. The best plumbers, chefs, doctors, etc.. get paid 10X-100X more than the average person in their field)
  - gives you control over your schedule ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5hx35sxmrqknxnnq589bqdw))
