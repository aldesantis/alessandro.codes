- Summary: Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM) is a marketing model that helps businesses analyze customer purchasing habits. It scores customers from 1 to 5 in three areas: how recently they bought, how often they buy, and how much they spend. This analysis helps companies identify their best customers and improve relationships with those who may not be as engaged.

## Highlights

- Recency, frequency, monetary value (RFM) is a model used in [marketing](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketing.asp) analysis that segments a company’s consumer base by their purchasing patterns or habits. In particular, it evaluates customers’ _recency_ (how long ago they made a purchase), _frequency_ (how often they make purchases), and _monetary value_ (how much money they spend).

- The more recently a customer has made a purchase with a company, the more likely they will continue to keep the business and [brand](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/branding-ultimate-economic-moat.asp) in mind for subsequent purchases.

- Despite the useful information that is acquired through RFM analysis, firms must take into consideration that even the best customers will not want to be over-solicited, and the lower-ranking customers may be cultivated with additional marketing efforts. It works as a snapshot of the clientele and as a tool to prioritize nurturing, but it should not be taken as a license to simply do more of the same old, same old sales techniques.
