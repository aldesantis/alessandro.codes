## Highlights

- I think one way you can think about this is that for a product to succeed, lots and lots of things have to go right. And if even one critical thing goes wrong — be it software design, or some hardware flaw, or market size, or manufacturing costs — the odds are good that the entire product flops. And so when you see enough examples of new product development, you’d quickly realise that all of the product development processes that I’ve described — Lean Startup, Working Backwards, Creative Selection, and Braintrust — are simply ways of iterating cheaply through an idea space, with sufficient feedback, in the hopes of checking enough boxes for success.
