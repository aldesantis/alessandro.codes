## Highlights

- The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.
  In practice you don’t have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrg9mdsqa875j7smzqwcfgr0))
- Once you’ve found something you’re excessively interested in, the next step is to learn enough about it to get you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. Knowledge expands fractally, and from a distance its edges look smooth, but once you learn enough to get close to one, they turn out to be full of gaps.

- The three most powerful motives are curiosity, delight, and the desire to do something impressive. Sometimes they converge, and that combination is the most powerful of all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrg9s7w1sks9r21dqdmcqa81))

- Ambition comes in two forms, one that precedes interest in the subject and one that grows out of it. Most people who do great work have a mix, and the more you have of the former, the harder it will be to decide what to do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrg9taj1bd142dew6aj637qc))
- When in doubt, optimize for interestingness. Fields change as you learn more about them. What mathematicians do, for example, is very different from what you do in high school math classes. So you need to give different types of work a chance to show you what they’re like. But a field should become _increasingly_ interesting as you learn more about it. If it doesn’t, it’s probably not for you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrg9w35c0nq8x0n882efjmpz))
- In most cases the recipe for doing great work is simply: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects, and something good will come of it. Instead of making a plan and then executing it, you just try to preserve certain invariants. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrg9yw5rfy33ksfs33fb9yeb))
- The trouble with exponential growth is that the curve feels flat in the beginning. It isn’t; it’s still a wonderful exponential curve. But we can’t grasp that intuitively, so we underrate exponential growth in its early stages. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrga54x6smr1q1vyq3hhz313))
- Something that grows exponentially can become so valuable that it’s worth making an extraordinary effort to get it started. But since we underrate exponential growth early on, this too is mostly done unconsciously: people push through the initial, unrewarding phase of learning something new because they know from experience that learning new things always takes an initial push, or they grow their audience one fan at a time because they have nothing better to do. If people consciously realized they could invest in exponential growth, many more would do it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrga61k4wvttfd6h1d4dkq0d))
- Work doesn’t just happen when you’re trying to. There’s a kind of undirected thinking you do when walking or taking a shower or lying in bed that can be very powerful. By letting your mind wander a little, you’ll often solve problems you were unable to solve by frontal attack. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrga6e1rxwewz7bpys2zzf11))
- Style is doing things in a distinctive way without trying to. Trying to is affectation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrga8phxt4b227fs47qw59xq))

- What formality and affectation have in common is that as well as doing the work, you’re trying to seem a certain way as you’re doing it. But any energy that goes into how you seem comes out of being good. That’s one reason nerds have an advantage in doing great work: they expend little effort on seeming anything. In fact that’s basically the definition of a nerd. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrgaaqj4fn6y5ncpt3a3vybz))

- When you’re doing work that could be seen as either creation or discovery, err on the side of discovery. Try thinking of yourself as a mere conduit through which the ideas take their natural shape. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrgae142scys2hmyc4ytxzd5))
- Original ideas don’t come from trying to have original ideas. They come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrhw5f0n1pq16v7974j9hjz8))
- Talking or writing about the things you’re interested in is a good way to generate new ideas. When you try to put ideas into words, a missing idea creates a sort of vacuum that draws it out of you. Indeed, there’s a kind of thinking that can only be done by writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrhw52bcanhztyh5m2pth1fj))
- Don’t divide your attention _evenly_ between many topics though, or you’ll spread yourself too thin. You want to distribute it according to something more like a power law. [[17](http://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html?s=09#f17n)] Be professionally curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.

- Seeing something obvious sounds easy. And yet empirically having new ideas is hard. What’s the source of this apparent contradiction? It’s that seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world. We see the world through models that both help and constrain us. When you fix a broken model, new ideas become obvious. But noticing and fixing a broken model is hard. That’s how new ideas can be both obvious and yet hard to discover: they’re easy to see after you do something hard. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrhw9204kff2znqeswdx12b6))
- What are people in your field religious about, in the sense of being too attached to some principle that might not be as self-evident as they think? What becomes possible if you discard it? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj73rgmq95k538m3rbr334r))

- People show much more originality in solving problems than in deciding which problems to solve. Even the smartest can be surprisingly conservative when deciding what to work on. People who’d never dream of being fashionable in any other way get sucked into working on fashionable problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj75z9ysgsv4spcg5j761df))
- Originality in choosing problems seems to matter even more than originality in solving them. That’s what distinguishes the people who discover whole new fields. So what might seem to be merely the initial step — deciding what to work on — is in a sense the key to the whole game. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj7864jfjt8560bk8ghxfcs))
- Sometimes you carry a question for a long time. Great work often comes from returning to a question you first noticed years before — in your childhood, even — and couldn’t stop thinking about. People talk a lot about the importance of keeping your youthful dreams alive, but it’s just as important to keep your youthful questions alive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj7amn0p1r8admx2cw1vzkn))

- It’s better to be promiscuously curious — to pull a little bit on a lot of threads, and see what happens. Big things start small. The initial versions of big things were often just experiments, or side projects, or talks, which then grew into something bigger. So start lots of small things. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj7cmw69m2jgqp03jb7rwds))
- Planning per se isn’t good. It’s sometimes necessary, but it’s a necessary evil — a response to unforgiving conditions. It’s something you have to do because you’re working with inflexible media, or because you need to coordinate the efforts of a lot of people. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj7fqgmb9sm4dyr70d8qdre))

- Originality is the presence of new ideas, not the absence of old ones. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj7pcyv8px5nn65m0fsk7ha))
- Some talented people are jerks, and this sometimes makes it seem to the inexperienced that being a jerk is part of being talented. It isn’t; being talented is merely how they get away with it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj7rkq9n87jx306k1hk9jv4))
- Indeed, work can to some extent protect you from your problems. If you choose work that’s pure, its very difficulties will serve as a refuge from the difficulties of everyday life. If this is escapism, it’s a very productive form of it, and one that has been used by some of the greatest minds in history. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj7xnsryqnpt603jysasq9s))
- People who do great work are not necessarily happier than everyone else, but they’re happier than they’d be if they didn’t. In fact, if you’re smart and ambitious, it’s dangerous _not_ to be productive. People who are smart and ambitious but don’t achieve much tend to become bitter.

- It’s ok to want to impress other people, but choose the right people. The opinion of people you respect is signal. Fame, which is the opinion of a much larger group you might or might not respect, just adds noise. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj81gjaqk306yzht09h1vp4))
- Curiosity is the best guide. Your curiosity never lies, and it knows more than you do about what’s worth paying attention to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hrj82919b1tmmyv7h7240p94))
