- Digital luxury goods fuel brand growth in mature markets because they relieve the pressure of compressed trend cycles on brands to constantly come up with the new stuff. They also lend a brand a trendy positioning, remove the barrier to a brand’s image and extend a brand’s appeal to multiple audiences. People who’d never consider a brand may go for its digital asset. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98nxppgcgr43qs8t1pn0krq))
- In terms of business, digital luxury assets are gold. They combine two traditionally high margin businesses: luxury and digital. The margin of digital GUCCI Dionysus is higher than the margin of physical GUCCI Dionysus (as is its price, as it happened recently).

- Digital luxury strategy is focused on creating, distributing and capturing social, cultural and economic capital. Social capital comes from participating in the community. Cultural capital is created by the outcome of this participation. Economic capital comes from the collectible value of digital luxury assets. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98p1y9grb2fjdmpe4g7x3f8))

- In the virtual world, upgrades are fractional, gamified, circular by nature and continuous rather than discrete. It doesn’t take discarding the old in favor of the new. Newness is additive rather than reductive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98p474c4sxr2x7wmdchyd41))

- Inability for digital goods to be faked is key: the digital world has infinite nature and zero marginal costs, making scarcity artificial. This is why scarcity also needs to be social. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98p6qaen5q63e78hhff0q08))

- The flywheel is the following: aesthetics creates value, identity amplifies this value through community, and status defines desirability through scarcity of ownership of and access to the identity. Value of a digital luxury asset is the outcome of this flywheel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h98p7qrv03s437y5crdfnbn6))
