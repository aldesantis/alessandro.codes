## Highlights

- Laid out in front of you, ideas can be re-read, critiqued, edited, tweaked or straight-up deleted. Writing is like applying a swiss army knife to your thought process. It helps you build a better set of ideas. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcvyczrss4k2z7n9qz3n7ze2))
- When you write to connect, your target audience is the judge of how well you write. It is impossible to claim _I write the world’s greatest product specs_ when your colleagues regularly misunderstand your proposals. Your comedy writing sucks if none of your readers chuckle. Your how-to post fails if people don’t scroll past the fold. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hcvyfpfzv2detx8gn007nxhm))
