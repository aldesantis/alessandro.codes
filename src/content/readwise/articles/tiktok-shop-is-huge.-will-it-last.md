## Highlights

- TikTok Shop is primarily, so far, a place for people to buy cheap, random stuff. The average order is around $30 — 1.3 items, on average — according to [NielsenIQ](https://nielseniq.com/global/en/), based on aggregated receipt data from September and October purchases. Some 28% of spending is in apparel and accessories; 24% in health and beauty; 10% in home and kitchen; 8% in electronics and accessories; and the remaining 30% in “other.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxv2tqwfg89wfrhy27zyqxa2))
- take: If your product or brand works on TikTok, it has a shot to work on TikTok Shop. If there’s something impulse-purchase-worthy, something visually compelling about it, or a dramatic unboxing moment, or something genuinely surprising, or if it’s an unexpected hidden gem, or something that at least might generate a conversation, it’s a good candidate.
