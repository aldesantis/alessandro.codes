## Highlights

- The goal of generative research, also known as exploratory or discovery research, is to help you identify a problem statement, frame the relevant problem to be solved, and gather enough evidence to move forward confidently.

- Generative research dives into “What problem might we solve?” while evaluative research asks, “How well is our solution working?”
- A fundamental role of the user researcher is to bridge the gap between what users say and how they actually feel.
