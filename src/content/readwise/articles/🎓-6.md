- Summary: Donâ€™t show people the same online ad too many times.

## Highlights

- Donâ€™t show people the same online ad too many times. Cap it at 3 times per person for general advertising (creating awareness and interest) and up to 6 times for those who have already shown interest in your product (e.g. already visited your website).
  Use static images (vs animations or videos) and change things up with multiple creatives to increase tolerance.
  Once you annoy people they pay less attention to you, so your ads are less likely to work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm971x8vrtxrzwq18xaj5h58))
