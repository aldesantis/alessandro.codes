## Metadata

- Author: [[Marty Cagan]]
- Full Title: Coaching – Collaboration
- Category: #articles
- URL: https://svpg.com/coaching-collaboration/

## Highlights

- collaboration is also not about compromise.  If you end up with a mediocre user experience, and slow performance and limited scalability, and dubious value for customers, as a team you lose.
