## Highlights

- Similar to the lifecycle of a customer, there’s also the lifecycle of an influencer. You have to show the product over and over to build trust with an audience since now more than ever, people are starting to become skeptical with traditional influencer posts. It’s important that when brands are working with influencers, they build trust over time with their audiences. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1nxh2sbr8whstaq1mpz23na))

- I know a lot of brands want complete tracking on a per-channel basis, but I think brands should look at influencer marketing as more of a top-of-funnel channel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1nxhx9533r8zx8z8g1tn2hf))

- There’s a group of metrics brands can look at. The first is effective CPM (cost per 1,000 impressions). You want to make sure your CPMs are in line with other channels. Another is engagement rates— did you get engagement on the influencer’s post. Do people seem interested in the product? Finally, what’s the sentiment of comments? Is it positive, negative, or neutral? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1nxk9gz4vdshtf047e7wwqd))

- Another way is to look at sales lift through a pre-post analysis. As long as other marketing channels are somewhat consistent, you can look at sales through all channels before and after a post went live. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1nxm37gc0g6nz9w4j2g8tpm))

- There are a few things brands should look out for prior to engaging with an influencer:
  1. Engagement rates
  2. % of posts that are sponsored
  3. Frequency and recency of posting
  Red flags across these would include low engagement, high % of sponsored posts, and infrequent posting. If none of those come up, the influencer is going to be a good candidate to work with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1nxp2ajcktw6pjych9hggvq))

- If brands want to pursue a gifting strategy, they should send products with no strings attached or expectations. Personally, I feel so much better about this, and 9 times out of 10 I’ll still post the product if I like it. It’s a much better way to approach creators vs. asking them to do their job for free.

- The point of using influencers is to _not_ make it look like an ad. When brands provide too much direction and reduce an influencer’s creative freedom, it won’t work. Influencers build a following by creating content that resonates with their audience, and if you limit their ability to do that then it’s not going to work.

- You need to think and account for how many touch points it’ll take for a consumer to build trust and consideration for your product. An influencer should post about a product or brand a few times before you evaluate results. You can’t cut it off early. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1nxsexyjy7ez2v2xqegchkf))
