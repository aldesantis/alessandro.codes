## Highlights

- People initially are not aware of what they don’t know (Wrong Intuition). We need to first teach them what they need to know so at least they are conscious of it, even if not yet competent (Wrong Analysis). From there, we ask them to practice it perfectly until they are competent (Right Analysis). And with enough practice, they’ll then build the right habit to not require so much deliberate attention to get it right anymore (Right Intuition). That’s how skills are developed and turned into a habit for an individual.
