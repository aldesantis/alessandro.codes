- Summary: The internet is changing due to the rise of AI, threatening the traditional roles of writers and publishers. AI-generated content and large language models (LLMs) may disrupt the connection between creators and audiences. To preserve the web as a valuable resource, it is crucial for platforms to prioritize human creativity and knowledge production over AI optimization.
