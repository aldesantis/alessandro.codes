## Highlights

- Algorithms were once believed to untether us from the masses and offer paths for personalization. But “For You” is not about pushing the limits of our artistic palates, but a device to serve us what the platform wants us to be satisfied with, herding us into perfectly predictable siloes that can be targeted with more “precise” recommendations. Anything other than this is a liability to the business model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0pn2tqn08h1e0jr0yx1trna))
- Human curation is great, for as long as these custodians of culture aren’t completely insulated, which, no different than algorithms, results in a homogeneous culture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0pn3yef8hyxvhyjvw361ekw))
- In an era of personal brands and monetizable reputations, every single one of our posts is a performance. If you exist online, there is no such thing as authenticity. This only becomes more true, the more eyeballs you have on you. Online, the world’s a stage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0pn7fef9n0qy1zb6ctnmn4p))
