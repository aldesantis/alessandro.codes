## Highlights

- It’s strange, but I know that it’s common to resist positive emotions, as well as negative ones. Ask yourself, next time you’re doing something enjoyable: are you really surrendering to the full enjoyment available here? The answer will often be no.

- I’ve worked with hundreds of unhappy creative people, and I can boil down most of my transferable insight into one sentence. I know that it feels horrible to create from a place of defense. For example: you will find it exceedingly difficult to write if your motive is trying to convince people that you are _not dumb,_ or _not boring,_ or if you’re hoping that you will not offend anybody.

- I know that being silly is a gift. You un-taboo silliness for everyone around you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1mkfpy2hjf9r4yh4s1rtgxe))
- I know that most people overrate the difficulty of hard conversations, and underrate how good it is to have them. Conflict avoidance slowly rots your whole life, and many people are about eight awkward discussions from a much-improved existence.

- I know that talent doesn’t feel like you’re amazing. It feels like the difficulties that trouble others are mysteriously absent in your case. Don’t ask yourself where your true gifts lie. Ask what other people seem weirdly bad at. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1mkjdej8gph6m7pwe1v5aka))
- I know that environmental influence is the most effective form of behavioral control. Accordingly, if you want radical change, radically change your environment. Being in the wrong city will cancel out years of self-improvement. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1mkkc4we4ngqnzprz5hqn5c))
- I know how to spot real confidence. Look for people who are fluid with status—who allow themselves to be the butt of a joke, or accept criticism, but also avoid false modesty, and inhabit the spotlight when it falls on them. One might call this a balance between dignity and humility. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1mkmdgwmm2k29v1970epd2x))
- I know that it’s easy to observe when people are feeling insecure. Notice how much they are mentioning their positive attributes, material possessions, or important friends, when there’s no conversational reason for this to be occurring other than a status claim. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1mkqaefhmb4ggt95ca9m04x))
- Much of sanity, and happiness, consists of finding the right mode for the right moment. The appreciative mode is terrible for debugging your business plan. But the evaluative mode is terrible for having a first date. A lot of capable, intelligent people suffer because they do not have the ability to switch out of the evaluative mode, or even notice that they’re in it.

- I know that if you have a serious dispute with someone, it will go nowhere unless you clearly name the underlying emotion that you’re struggling with. If you’re afraid that your partner will abandon you, cataloging their flaws will not communicate this effectively. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1r6f3wjd38rscmts0kcgawh))
- I know that freedom is earned by confronting things that embarrass and trigger you, over and over again, until you are cringe-proof in your desired environment. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1r6j0hnfhrzxjtt26e1d6z4))
- I know how to instantly calm yourself, and, in social situations, ground your energy, thus making you more charismatic. Without effort, include the bottom of your feet in your conscious awareness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1r6jxtvhhyvyex8369ycdsw))

- I know that silence is an underused conversational tactic. It makes people more interesting and builds intimacy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1r6mee5mwk5x8zcw7dnvqcc))
