- Summary: Retail has been evolving rapidly due to Covid-related shocks, accelerating changes such as the growth of curbside pickup and increased use of mobile apps. Top industry executives predict that the future of retail will involve smaller, more experiential stores located where customers prefer, with an emphasis on efficiency and personalized experiences. Additionally, advancements in technology, such as conversational commerce and predictive analytics, are expected to transform the industry and enhance customer satisfaction. The role of stores is envisioned to become more experiential, serving as mini distribution centers and hubs for community engagement, while the majority of shopping may still happen in-store despite online browsing trends among younger generations.

## Highlights

- The role of the store needs to be much more experiential than it is today. I think consumers are going to raise the bar, and they’re just going to expect that because when you can just shop and do a transaction a click away, there has to be a higher purpose for a store.

- You need to make sure that stores are great and that they’re well looked after and they’re inspirational places to shop. But there is an ‘and,’ and the ‘and’ is that they are also last-mile fulfillment nodes that allow you to serve those customers in the way they want.

- It’s not going to be one or the other, and I really believe in this notion of integrated retail — that customers will continue to shop differently depending on the day of the week, their mood and what they’re looking for.

- Shopping will not look like shopping. Shopping will feel like an experience that could happen in your home or in the most beautiful space, where the product has a key role, but where everything else around the product, from service and experience, will be at the center. I would imagine a store that actually doesn’t have a lot of visible products, doesn’t have a cash register, but is really an incredible room where you go and you have a moment for yourself, where products are presented to you, where you have the time to step out of the room, have a drink at the bar, come back.
