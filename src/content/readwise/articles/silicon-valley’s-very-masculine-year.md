- Summary: Silicon Valley has seen a shift towards a more masculine culture in recent years. The leaders of the tech industry are embracing a more muscular and aggressive image, with a focus on physical strength and combat. This shift has led to a decrease in diversity and representation of women in tech leadership roles. The change in culture can be attributed to factors such as the desire for financial success and the influence of influential figures like Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. Additionally, the competitive nature of the industry has contributed to a more ruthless and cutthroat environment.

- As we enter 2024, it’s clear that Silicon Valley’s masculinity phase is far from over. While the pendulum may eventually shift toward a climate that’s slightly more welcoming to women and minorities, it seems unlikely that social progress will become a priority anytime soon within the tightening tech economy.
