- Summary: Mortimer Adler’s “How to Read a Book” explains four levels of reading: for entertainment, to inform, to understand, and to master. Elementary and inspectional reading are key for deciding if a book is worth deeper analysis, followed by analytical reading for understanding and syntopical reading for mastering a subject by comparing various sources. Each level requires different approaches, from skimming to deep analysis, to become a demanding reader who asks critical questions and seeks answers.
