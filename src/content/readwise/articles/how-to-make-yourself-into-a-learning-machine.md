## Highlights

- Zettelkasten is German for “slip box” and is a method to manage knowledge. Basically, you take ideas from books, articles or conversations and write those ideas on note cards, collect them in a central database, and link them together so that you can start to find larger relationships between concepts you’re learning.

- When I highlight something from a book that contains an idea, concept, metaphor, or generally something more abstract, I’ll put it into my Zettelkasten instead of my flashcard system. These highlights aren’t to be remembered, they are to be connected.

- Memory gives you a web of facts for you to put new information into context, and answer questions with deduction without having to go look something up.

    - Note: An example of this is learning the trait signature of a historic period, so that you can put facts that happened in that period in context.
