## Highlights

- If you’re building a product, you must also think of go-to-market as you build. You’re connecting your product’s value to how the market already works.

- For any product to reach its adoption and commercial potential, its value must be exceptional enough to displace an existing product, behavior or belief. It must do so for customers who can also help grow your business. Figuring this out is an iterative, dynamic process in which every product leader must be a partner and ask “what can we do better to enable evangelistic product adoption?”
