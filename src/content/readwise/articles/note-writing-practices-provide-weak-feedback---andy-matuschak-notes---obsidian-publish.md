## Metadata

- Author: [[publish.obsidian.md]]
- Full Title: Note-Writing Practices Provide Weak Feedback - Andy Matuschak Notes - Obsidian Publish
- Category: #articles
- URL: https://publish.obsidian.md/andymatuschak/Note-writing+practices+provide+weak+feedback

## Highlights

- In traditional note-taking the feedback is very delayed: when you write a note, you may not see it again for weeks. The feedback is also ambiguous: if a note helps you distill some insight (or fail to), that wonâ€™t be especially evident.
