  Speaker 1
  Yeah. I don’t think in terms of when it came time to market the event, I don’t know that we did anything super special. I think a lot of that hard work was done building the brand in the years leading up to the event. And what I will say is I think so this brand has a lot of depth to it. I think our the quality of our relationship to our customer is deep. And I think a lot of that is attributed to our newsletter. There’s a lot of writing that goes into this brand. It’s very like it’s because I started this, you know, by myself during COVID, face map, like it was very it was almost like a blog that I wrote weekly every Sunday. And there is it’s every Sunday. I still do it. I don’t always make it every Sunday, but it’s a really candid kind of piece of writing that has no sales link to it. There’s no buy now. There’s no nothing. And there are different topics that have to do with, you know, building the business or, you know, navigating different parts of my identity or, you know, even a breakup, like it’s just Very candid, but it all kind of comes back to this idea of living in full. What does it mean to live in full color? Which is what we say here at mixed. And I don’t like so many people who have come to the studio have pulled me aside to say, now Zara, I read this newsletter. I remember this time where you wrote this thing that said this, or I printed it out, I put it on my wall, or I printed, I shared it with a friend. And I really think that it was a lot of it was there were at some point over the last some years, I’d written something that resonated with someone on a deeper level that stuck with them. And I think that provided the credibility to then when it came time for us to, you know, host an event, there was already some trust built there that people were like excited to then meet In person. Because that’s my take on it. ([Time 0:17:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5495b4b6-7b3c-451a-b436-9d132f08e252))
