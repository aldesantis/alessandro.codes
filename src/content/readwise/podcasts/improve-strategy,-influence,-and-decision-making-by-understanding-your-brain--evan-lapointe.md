  If you enjoy running, you’re probably going to run more than if you don’t enjoy running. If you enjoy doing a podcast, you’re probably going to make a better podcast and you’re going to do it for longer if you enjoy doing it. So there’s something really, really important about enjoyment because it’s not only a measure of efficiency. It also has a strong correlation with higher in most things, has a strong correlation with how long you’re going to do it, your staying power, the quality of what you’re going to do, all Of that. So that’s one of the reasons that I think enjoyment is really great. The other thing is that if you enjoy things, they feel different. And it doesn’t require that. I think one of the things that people do is they they they say this they say I Want to join my life more so I’m gonna do less things like take out the trash and I’m gonna do more things like go On vacation But that’s not how enjoyment works and like you can enjoy taking out the trash or you can hate taking out the trash. That’s a choice and Right now somebody listening to this is an experiment that they can run is like, okay, you’re going to stay listening to this for the next minute. How do you enjoy it 10% more? And typically what will happen is somebody will take a deeper breath, they’ll settle into their body ([Time 0:41:16](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1d45cff4-6056-4fa0-a7df-97c60ffc05c2))
- Embrace Enjoyment to Elevate Life
  Summary:
  Finding ways to enjoy what you are doing in the present increases the likelihood of engaging in activities you love.
  Many wealthy individuals invest heavily in arranging enjoyable lives, yet still find dissatisfaction. Contrary to this, recognizing the importance of enjoyment in everyday actions leads to greater effectiveness and less fear of pursuing pleasure.
  This shift in perspective allows individuals to prioritize joy now rather than postponing it for an uncertain future, fundamentally changing how they engage with life.

  In our society, typically it’s how to enjoy what you’re doing more. What happens typically is that if you find a way to enjoy the thing that you’re doing more, you’re more likely to do the things that you enjoy. So it’s just like a, it’s just a order of operations thing as compared to there’s people, you know, a lot of the people in my circles because of who I coach and everything, they’re billionaires And they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to arrange a life that they enjoy and it doesn’t fucking work. So they actually have more power to make everything that they’re doing exactly what they want to do, but that doesn’t work. Flying the jet or buying the island or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah doesn’t do it. So whereas if you really learn to enjoy what’s in front of you, all of a sudden one thing that happens is that you’re not as scared of enjoyment. Like you start saying, oh wow, enjoyment makes me really effective. And so I’m one to do the things that I enjoy. And so you’re more likely to do the things that you enjoy. Instead of having this story, I have to do X, Y, and Z so that at one point in the future, I can do what I enjoy. And so that, it’s just an order of operations things.

- Embrace the Journey, Release the ‘Shoulds’
  Summary:
  Avoiding the phrase ‘I should’ fosters a stagnant mindset, leading to a fear of failure and reluctance to try again.
  Instead, adopting a perspective of experimentation—such as ‘I want to’ or ‘I can try this’—promotes movement and progress. Authenticity lies in recognizing that one is already whole and does not require constant improvement, much like the natural growth of an oak tree at every stage of its life.
  Each phase is valid and beautiful, illustrating that personal growth should be viewed as a journey rather than a deficit to be fixed.

  Speaker 1
  Yeah, that would, well, should, they can, they get to. It’s a great experiment. It’s an experiment, okay, perfect. Yeah, the reason I do the should thing is that as soon as you say you should, and then you don’t, then you can fail, and if you fail, you’re less likely to try it again. That’s why the should just, it ends up usually in stagnation. Should, like if you, if you like think about the way it feels in your body, when you say I should do something, there’s like a stagnation. There’s a, whereas if you say something like, oh, I want to do it, or here’s an experiment I can do, or here’s what I enjoy. There’s less stagnation, there’s more movement.
  Speaker 2
  This touches on something else that you talk a lot about. And we’ve kind of been circling around this idea of authenticity versus improvement, where you help people realize that you are good as you are, you don’t need to necessarily improve. We’ve talked a lot about these sorts of things already, but just what else can you share there, just how to help people learn this? Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  I mean, my, my favorite metaphor on this one is like, at what time. And the journey of an oak tree is a perfect, is it like when it’s an acorn, when it’s a sprout, when it’s 20 years old, 40 years old, 150 years old, 200 years old, depending on the oak tree. Like now I’m perfect. The idea is ridiculous. So it’s a similar thing for us. So the idea that I need to improve myself, it ([Time 0:45:51](https://share.snipd.com/snip/016870ea-93f9-4c9c-b57e-4d2e6137d9ad))
- Deep Understanding Through Focused Inquiry
  Summary:
  Effective problem-solving requires a deep understanding of both the problem and its solution.
  Dedicating attention to a problem leads to enhanced comprehension, thereby facilitating resolution. A valuable approach to assessing someone’s claimed contributions involves delving into details through a series of probing questions.
  By asking about the specifics of their achievements and the rationale behind their decisions, one can discern genuine problem solvers from those merely claiming success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  I just mean it practically. You know, it’s like, can you really fully understand a problem if you don’t understand the solution to it? I don’t So if there’s a principle, and I can’t remember the name of it, like it’s Strickland principle or something, but it’s something that the CFO that I used to work with said. And he would say, like, problems get solved if you spend time on them. Like if you just give enough attention to a problem, the problems will solve. That’s the way it works. In business, an unsolvable problem, obviously, it’s not going to work that way. But the reason that that works is because the more you spend time on a problem, the more you understand it. And another way, love him or you know, one of the things that Elon Musk has said that I find, that I found a very valuable in my time is that if you really want to interview somebody and they Claim that they’ve done something, you ask them like kind of six levels down. So you improve sales. How did you do that exactly? While we we improved the pipeline. Okay. How’d you do that exactly? Oh, well, we made the pipeline more measurable by having things that could be very, okay. And so how did you know what were the seven stages of the pipeline and what made you pick them? You go six levels down and you can really understand if somebody was the person who solved the problem or if they’re the person who is claiming that they solved the problem.

- Embrace Tension to Build Great Teams
  Summary:
  Understanding and embracing emotional experiences, including tension and conflict, enhances decision-making and collaboration.
  Avoiding conflict can hinder team development, as great teams are forged through the resolution of tension. Just as life and growth require tension in various forms, so too do successful teams.
  Acknowledging and engaging with these challenging emotions is essential for fostering a productive and harmonious work environment.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  There’s a couple more experiments I want to help people try to run. One is you have some really good advice around decision-making and how emotions and getting better at understanding and working with your emotions helps you make better decisions. Can you talk about that?
  Speaker 1
  That’s similar to what I said before which is if you learn to fall in love with the emotional experiences, then you have more solution sets. So let’s say I want to, I want to have like all human beings. I want to be a part of a great team. There’s no, no, nobody has ever like raised their hand and said, I’d like to be a part of a shitty team. And yet. Grand majority of people at their work right now have shitty teams or not a teams, not great teams, even though nobody wants that. If one of the things you’re unwilling to feel is that conflict, that tension, as we talked about, if your conflict avoid it, you’re not going to be able to make an A team, because there’s Nothing that is alive doesn’t require tension. A cell requires tension. Breathing requires tension. Playing pickleball requires tension. ([Time 0:55:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7856f913-dec0-4145-b73a-0e2ae94d6f67))
- Transform Frustration into Growth
  Summary:
  Decision-making frustrations often reveal underlying problems within an organization.
  When individuals commit to improving the quality of their meetings, a transformation occurs. For instance, by focusing on making meetings enjoyable, one person saw significant improvements in their output and results.
  This demonstrates that enhancing the meeting experience often corresponds to addressing larger systemic issues, leading to greater productivity and success.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  If you really start unpacking how the decisions are made, where people are frustrated in the decision-making process, you’re gonna find exactly the problems in the company. An example of this, I was working with a friend, and he’s a content person, and we were just talking about how do you make every one of your meetings a five-star meeting? And he’s like, okay, great. I’m gonna do it. He’s like, yeah, I’m never gonna do this. I was like, really? Tell me why my YouTube meetings fucking suck. That’s not where he makes most of his money, but it’s like, these YouTube meetings suck. They’re never gonna get better. And luckily, there’s a couple other people around at the time. And everyone’s like, no, I love my YouTube meetings. What do you mean? Like, how could this not work for you? And, and so he, he noticed like, oh, I like the team did didn’t the content. None of it was working for him. None of it was him. He was just like, Oh, and so he changed it. He was like, okay, I’m going to commit to that. I’m going to see what it’s like for me to just say. Every one of my YouTube meetings have to be something that’s super enjoyable to me. And when he did it, like his YouTube numbers went off the charts in like a very short period of time. It’s just that common, like wherever the meeting is, it sucks. It means there’s something else that’s a problem that needs to be worked on. So that’s typically how.
