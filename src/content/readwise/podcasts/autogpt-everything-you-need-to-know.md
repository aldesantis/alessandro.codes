## Highlights

- **Personalized Websites**

  - Users might interact with a chat interface that dynamically generates a webpage tailored to their specific needs.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Well, what you’re saying is that the segment of one and the websites idea could merge and that you could have a million different versions of your website. I completely believe that.
  Speaker 2
  That’s mind blowing. It’s mind blowing.
  Speaker 1
  That we either you could go from a website that a whole team of people work on for most companies now for like one homepage and say, yeah, it’s not one homepage.
  Speaker 2
  I’m going to have a million home. ([Time 0:14:29](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e2438c90-9fee-4d52-9d32-0bb9884fb054))
- **AI: Money Making > Money Saving**
  - Most businesses focus on AI for cost-saving.
  - The biggest opportunity lies in using AI for generating revenue, not just reducing expenses.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  And this goes to my big, big thing. If you look at the top’s use cases, you know what they are, Kieran? They’re money saving, not money making. If you weren’t listening to this show, watching this show on YouTube, I think the biggest opportunity in AI is not money saving, it’s money making. All of these claims processing, fraud detection, they are trying to save you money, reduce risk, reduce expense off your balance sheet, because that’s where the economic climate Is right now. I think AI has much bigger potential to transform how your sales team operates, how your marketing team generates, leads, demand, customers, all of those things. And there’s much more opportunity in making money than saving money. Do you agree with your discussion? I think it’s both.
  Speaker 2
  Well, it’s both, but I’m arguing that making money is the bigger of the two opportunities. I think AI is potentially incredibly deflationary. And the way that companies be much more profitable is to make their companies much, much leaner.
  Speaker 1
  Are you agreeing with me or disagreeing with me? Are you thinking AI is better for saving?
  Speaker 2
  You’ve been thinking a lot of cases, it’s better for saving money, but then there’s like use cases and jobs that you cannot do today or things that you cannot sell today because they’re Not possible that AI will make possible. There’s new businesses that will be created through AI and they are money making. And then there are existing businesses that will integrate AI and they will be money saving.
  Speaker 1
  Look, I think that even the existing businesses, the ones that spend more of their time on money making versus money saving will have the ([Time 0:19:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/54e4a9d8-9d76-4568-8eb9-cb2789371427))
- **Focus on Money-Making AI**
  - Prioritize AI for increasing revenue over cost-cutting.
  - The potential for growth through increased productivity is much larger than the limited savings from fixed expenses.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Look, I think that even the existing businesses, the ones that spend more of their time on money making versus money saving will have the bigger upside. It doesn’t mean that you’re not going to save money, that doesn’t mean that you’re not going to get leaner. But the problem with using AI to save money is that you have a fixed set of expense, right? Like you know you spend a million dollars on this thing a year and you’re like, oh, I can use AI to save half of it. So you have a cap on what you can achieve. You can only save half a million dollars in that example, right?
  Speaker 2
  When it comes to money making your potential. I’m struggling to see how you can differentiate these things. Let me give you like, I’m not a company and I’m a hundred person sales team. And I’m like, okay, well, I want AI to make my sales team much, much more efficient. I think what I’m going to end up with it is a smaller sales team and a better sales funnel.
  Speaker 1
  You can argue there’s two ways of looking at this. You could argue, hey, I’m going to meet my existing sales quota with less cost because my sales reps are going to become more productive. Or I believe I could make all of the sales reps I have three times more productive and I’m going to triple my revenue, right? That’s a perfect example.
  Speaker 2
  And I think the latter is the bigger opportunity for first movers. This is my point that I made in a previous show, which is like by the viewers, there has never been a potential better time to integrate this and land grab. But at the time, the laggards integrate AI. I don’t think that opportunity exists because it just becomes, again, come back to the very thing I started with. The incentives reduced for everyone. And so everyone is like less in a worse situation. ([Time 0:20:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/39cac50f-f4c5-4ff9-a194-a05152ebbc6b))
- **Google Reimagines Search**
  - Google is reimagining search beyond the traditional blue links.
  - They aim to reinvent information retrieval, potentially by becoming an aggregator of aggregators and focusing on transactions rather than just clicks.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  But I want to be really clear in the language they use because this wasn’t we’re going to integrate AI. This was we are going to reimagine what search is. And that is the point that I have been making repeatedly that the blue links click click click is a historical way that we used to retrieve information and is not going to be the way we retrieve Information in the future.
  Speaker 1
  Kieran, I still think our best marketing against the grain swag idea is just a hoodie that says legacy and has blue links below it.
  Speaker 3
  Because it’s just like the whole way of doing it.
  Speaker 2
  If you want that jumper hoodie, add a comment into the YouTube and we will get you that hoodie.
  Speaker 1
  If you want that as the first MATG swag, let us know.
  Speaker 2
  And so they want to reimagine search. And so the big thing about that is we talked to Neil Patel, we had him on the show. You can go back and listen to that episode. It was a great episode. We went through chat TBT. Does it crush search and advertise? And Neil is on the side that Google is going to weather this storm and SEO, everything is all good. But the one thing we did talk about in that that is part of this PR release is there may be a different way for Google to monetize this experience outside of search, which is through transactions Because now they can be the aggregator of aggregators, which means like bookin.com and kayak. Why do you need any of this when you have a natural language platform that can do all of this stuff for you? I can just tell it what to do and it goes into it for me. Yeah.
  Speaker 1
  We talked about a solution with Neil where bids are going to move from bidding on advertisements to bidding on revenue share in the transactions. And I think that is a big part of the future of search. So Google, chat GPT, auto ([Time 0:25:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/dc85c3c0-2172-4df1-a1f0-69ef4bdba66b))
