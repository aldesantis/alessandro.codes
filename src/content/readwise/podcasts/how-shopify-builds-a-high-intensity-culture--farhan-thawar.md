## Highlights

- **Choose the Harder Path**
  - Choose the harder path when faced with multiple options.
  - This leads to valuable learning experiences, even if the outcome isn’t successful.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  Okay. Advice that I’ve heard you share with people often is when they’re trying to decide amongst a bunch of options is to choose the harder path because that makes life easier down the road. Share this advice, why it’s so important, where you learn, where you kind of like develop that this is the right approach.
  Farhan Thawar
  But the short version is that if you have a choice and you choose the easy thing and it, and it works great. If you choose the hard thing and it works great, like you kind of did more work, but if it doesn’t work and you chose the easy thing, you’ve actually not learned anything because you kind Of chose the, like, you haven’t done a lot of work. You haven’t probably worked with the smartest people because they don’t usually, or they’re not usually around in the easy path. And what happens is you’ve gone through this exercise and now you’re like, I’ve kind of lost, I lost the choice and, or I, I, I was trying to do something I didn’t have, it didn’t work out For me. But if you do the hard path and it doesn’t work, actually, you still kind of win, because you’ve now done something hard, you’ve probably worked with smart people, you’ve learned something Along the way that is like valuable. And I can give you like a quick example. So I meet lots of like job seekers. And they’re like, I go, what are you doing to try to find a job? I’m like, I’m sending out 10 resumes a day. I’m like, okay, that sounds like kind of easy. And like, are you really learning anything from sending out 10 resumes a day? Versus I would say to them, hey, you know, all these companies you’re interested in, Shopify might be one of them. Why don’t you look at the API docs and build something, build a Shopify app, build an admin extension, like build something on top of Shopify. Even if you don’t get a job at Shopify, right, which is maybe your goal, you’ve learned something, you’ve built something, you have things in your GitHub repo now, you can show people. You’re learning about the product. That might translate to a job you might get somewhere else. So I think that even though it’s harder, right? Of course, you can’t every day build an app on a different platform. Maybe you can once a day. You will learn something in the hard path. And the same thing happened to me in taking hard courses. I would get worse marks, but I ended up meeting smarter people in those courses because they were there for the same reason I was, because the content was hard. So that’s something that I’ve just realized in my life that if I do the hard thing, and I just naturally tend towards doing that, like I ended up doing, I went to Waterloo and I did a minor In electric engineering on top of computer science. And when I did my MBA, I did a minor in financial engineering because the smarter people were in that path. And they’re still my friends today. So ([Time 0:05:42](https://share.snipd.com/snip/61baa728-9f3d-4b2f-9f2c-5e6f8df68ea7))
- **Focus on Learning**
  - Prioritize learning and growth in your career path.
  - Seek out challenging opportunities and collaborate with smart people.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  On that building on the last point just made people could hear this and think, OK, if it’s harder, that’s going to be the right path. Sometimes harder is still like a bad idea. Like, for example, joining a terrible company that’s extremely frustrating to work at or building, I don’t know, a house in a really dumb way, but it’s just really hard. What else do you find is important to think about when you’re thinking it’s not just harder, but also XYZ should probably be true. Yeah.
  Farhan Thawar
  One real one is, of course, the people, because I find that my path has always focused on trying to pick the best learning journey. Where can I learn the most? And for me, everyone’s different. Some people might learn better from books or the domain they’re in. But for me, I learn a lot from people. And so I try to put myself in those harder rooms on purpose. There was a time when I was doing my MBA in financial engineering, by the way. And I mean, I was, I’m a tech guy and still a tech guy. And all these people were going into like finance jobs. There was a point where somebody said to me, why are you in this class? Because they knew that I was doing it for fun. Right. And so it was because it was the learning journey. And so I would say a big part of it for me is, yes, there’s the how do you win even if you lose? Because if it goes poorly, you can still come out of it with skills. But if you actually take the hard path, you’ll have these like intense working relationships with smart people that again will continue on in your life. And that also just forces you to be in this constant state of uncomfort by going into these rooms and saying, I don’t know anything. And it’s harder. And I agree with you. You don’t want to do dumb things like, oh, let’s just do this thing in a dumb way. That’s not what I mean. I mean, let’s do the, let’s, let’s try to do the hard thing that we can learn, learn from.

- **Embracing Dumb Questions**
  - Farhan Thawar recounts being told he asked the “stupidest fucking question.”
  - He emphasizes his goal is understanding, not annoyance.
  Transcript:
  Farhan Thawar
  And by the way, it happens to be on the path. It’s just as a, is a, it might take more manual work or it might not be the way most people do it, but we think we can learn more from that path.
  Lenny Rachitsky
  Speaking of that, uh, I found this great quote from you. Not everyone can look stupid in public over and over, but I believe it’s my superpower and I try to make it my whole team superpower too. ([Time 0:09:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e504c679-6f24-49e2-a06c-359ff49f2f2c))
- **Intensity over Hours**
  - Maximize output per minute instead of working longer hours.
  - Highly skilled individuals produce high-quality work quickly.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  I want to come back to Extreme Labs. I know there’s other stories there that are interesting, but first I want to talk about another theme of things that people often raised when asked about you. And this one is intensity. And it’s specifically creating intensity in your organization, the value of that, the power of that. I’ve seen the way you describe this and I love is how do you expend more kilojoules per hour versus spend more hours on work? So talk about just why intensity, first of all, is so important to an organization.
  Farhan Thawar
  Yeah. So I think there’s a few things. One, I have this fundamental belief that like one hour is one hour. Like it’s the same hour, right? If you spend an hour, I spend an hour. It’s the same time that goes by. And if I just expend more calories in that hour, right? Like we both are, you know, let’s say we both work nine to five. If I can just get more done in the nine to five, we have both, the time has elapsed the same for us, but I just got more done. And that allows me, of course, then it’d be like, hey, I’m going to take my kid to soccer and do other stuff. Like we can still do the same things out of work, but during work, I just want to try to get as much done as possible during the time versus expanding the time. And I can give you an example, right? I used to work at a company where, you know, it was like, I worked 12 hours a day, but I was playing foosball in the middle of the day. And then we’d go for a coffee break. And like, you kind of do these things. And of course, the time expanded to 12 hours versus, you know, trying to compress into that eight hour day. And pair programming is a great example because so it’s such an intense activity, two people on one machine. You can get so much done when two people are working together not being distracted by the internet and distractions and just focus on writing like the solution to the problem at hand And it’s so tiring that usually when people switch on to pair programming they sleep like you know 10 12 hours a night the first few nights because it’s so intense you’re’re working so Hard. But for me, that intensity actually leads to like extraordinary outcomes, even if you don’t have to put in more hours. Like I think most people I you probably hear this all the time, everyone says, oh, yeah, like work hard and like, do more hours when you’re young, whatever. I’m like, what if you just did more per minute? Right? Like, quickly get through things. I think there’s another unintuitive fact is that people who are really good can actually output high quality collateral quickly. So like take a person who is good and extremely good. The extremely good person can actually get a lot of output in a short amount of time. And the person who’s good might take longer. Like I think there’s a, there’s a time variance there that people don’t think about. So you can kind of like not drop the quality too much, but get the time down by like 2x, 3x, right? Like Parkinson’s law at scale, instead of, you know, if I give you an hour to do something, a really good person can get a high quality output in one hour. I ([Time 0:19:20](https://share.snipd.com/snip/068afb7b-b9da-4ddf-9cbb-8689a768389d))
- **Pair Programming Power**
  - Pair programming, though seemingly slower, accelerates value delivery.
  - It focuses on finding elegant solutions, not just writing code.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  Want to talk about how you create an org that operates this way. But specifically, just mentioned pair programming and that’s one of your favorite tools. Talk about why this is so powerful when you recommended, I think as an outside observer, it’s like two engineers on the same code. Why wouldn’t we do things half as fast? Talk about just why you’re a big fan of pair programming specifically.
  Farhan Thawar
  It is the most underutilized management tool in engineering, bar none. Like it is just not used as much as it could be. So pair programming, you know, for those who don’t know, it’s two people on one computer, right? So two keyboards, two mics, two monitors, but one computer, they work together. And if it’s remote, they use it, you can use a tool like Tuple, like which we use, and you can just remotely be on one computer. And you’re totally right. The famous tweet about pair programming is, wait a sec, we have two engineers on one computer. Won’t they write half as much code? And the answer is, oh, no, no, they’re right even less than that. Because it’s not about lines of code, right? The throughput limiter is not hands-on keyboard. It’s not like we’re both sitting there and the limiter is like us trying to get through the key, like the keystrokes onto the screen. The limiter is, where the good, elegant solution? How do we think through the problem and build the right solution for the problem at hand? You know, Toby famously built a lot of Shopify pair programming. And what he would do is he would actually set a timer and him and his, the CTO, Cody, would pair program for one hour. And if they did not finish the problem in one hour, they would delete all the code and they would keep the tests and they would start over. And then what they’re thinking was, if we were not able to articulate and write the code for this feature in one hour, we must be on the wrong design. We must be building the wrong thing. And so they delete all the code, kept the tests, and then wrote it again. And sometimes it’d be over by one minute. And he would still delete the code and start over. Because his thinking was the right elegant solution should be able to be written in one hour. And so pair programming, I mean, that’s an extreme version of it. But even at like Pivotal Labs, if your pair was sick that day and you wrote a bunch of code, the strong version is like your pair would come in the next day, delete all the code that you wrote, And then you’d write it again the next day. And again, like what better time to rewrite code than like right after you’ve written it? Because you now know the problem domain. And it’s, by the way, it sounds like a waste of time, right? Like it sounds like I’m just deleting code. But the reason is that code lives a long time. Code is a liability. And the right solution, the usually shorter lines, more elegant solution, tends to appear after you’ve done a bunch of pathfinding. And the only way to do that pathfinding is kind of start and then delete and then start and be like, oh, no, now I know. Delete. And it’s super hard to delete, by the way, because, you know, we’re humans and we have this sunk cost fallacy. So it’s hard to delete. But if you can do that, you will actually land upon like a much, much better solution. And of course, pair programming has high, high rates of learning because you’re just like sitting beside, like you’re not only, you know, whether it’s tuple or remote, like, or directly You’re, you’re learned keystrokes and you learn how somebody thinks about a problem. You go back and forth on the talking. And yes, you will write like probably less code, but you will move faster along the path of like delivering value for your customers than you would if you did it on your own. And there’s all these studies that show happiness is higher, knowledge transfer is higher, less silos, intensity is higher, all the things. And at a price of like, you know, 20% or something of like what you would normally do. The analogy I have is the underhanded free throw in basketball, right? Statistically known to sink more baskets, but looks dumb and nobody does it. Like literally Shaquille O’Neal, I’m not that big a basketball fan, but I read this about Shaquille O’Neal, who was a hall of famer. And they said, why don’t you throw underhand? Cause like he was notoriously bad at free throws and he goes, it looks dumb. Even though he’s paid millions of dollars a year to do this thing. It looks dumb. Doesn’t want to do it.

- **Shopify’s Intensity Methods**
  - Shopify uses weekly updates and six-week reviews for increased intensity.
  - This creates accountability and facilitates quick adjustments based on feedback.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  In the future. Okay, I want to come back to what else you have done at Shopify to create intensity. And I think, again, it’s important to highlight the intensity is meant to how do we get more done in the time we have and then go home, not just work all day, every day, weekends kind of intensity. Yeah.
  Farhan Thawar
  So we have a few things that we have going for us, right? So one, we have this tool called GSD, which stands for get shit done, which you probably heard from maybe talking to other Shaba folk, which is this notion of like weekly updates to the Whole company on what’s happening. Again, Parkinson’s law at scale. If you ask people every week, they want to show progress every single week. So that’s one way I talked about pair programming as well. The other thing we do as a company is we used to have like twice a year was our cadence. We like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, or like we had like an event in the summer. And now we do six week reviews. So teams have this notion of like every six weeks, actually coming together and walking through the roadmap, the resourcing and what they’re working on with their immediate leadership, But then also with Toby. And so what’s cool about that, and by the way, it’s a huge time investment, right? We all get into a room, it’s happening tomorrow. So Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, we’re going on, you know, a bunch of us will be in the office together and we’re going to go through every project in the company. And we’re going to talk about the project, the resourcing, how it’s going, and we’re going to make changes. And again, that creates intensity because you want to show what has been done. What have you learned since the last six week review? And we find six weeks is a very good cadence because it’s short enough that you can remember the context and it’s long enough. Six weeks is long enough, especially if you have, you know, let’s say a team is a dozen engineers, you can do a lot. And not only that, you can do a lot in a day, but this is like kind of like a check-in point. And what I’ve noticed too with intensity is, let’s say we get a review and there’s some feedback we get in that review. We don’t wait till the next six week review, right? Like the next day we are building things, we are iterating, we are tagging people. And then by the next six weeks, we’re like, here’s, here’s the trajectory. I actually want to get that Elon shirt made. What have you done this week? Because Parkinson’s law is real. It sounds funny, but I keep bringing this up, but whatever time you allot to something will be the time it takes. So if you’re doing something monumental, like, I don’t know, you’re doing like a reorg or something, you can do it the slow way. Let’s sit down and plan and roll it out over and it’s probably like six months in most companies Shopify this is like a week or two you sit down you’re like hey this is kind of the bones of It let’s bring some more people and think then you know it’s going to start like leaking so we just like launch it right and we do the same thing with lots of uh things shop we just try to move More quickly and get out of the chain we don’t do change management we kind of just like land it and then go, Hey, everyone, it’s kind of like a volatile company. This is what’s happening, but this is how we get things done quickly and then move on with our lives. Wow. ([Time 0:29:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/09ae8039-f29d-4852-a926-eab472aa96ac))
- **Meeting Armageddon**
  - Delete recurring meetings to combat inertia and free up time.
  - Implement a moratorium on new recurring meetings to encourage thoughtful scheduling.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  Love that. OK, one thing you mentioned is meeting thing for people that don’t know what you all did with meetings. I think it might be worth just sharing that briefly because it’s awesome and something a lot of companies can learn from. Yeah, sure.
  Farhan Thawar
  Actually, the funny story about the meeting Armageddon is that I was messaging Toby prior to me starting at Shopify about meeting Armageddon. And so I actually think I had a little hand in him like doing this before I got to Shopify because I was like, hey, have you seen, I think it was Dropbox. Have you seen what Dropbox is doing and meeting again? And so he was like, this is super interesting. This is years before I started. So I think it’s funny that it ended up being a real thing. But here’s what we do. Once a year at a random time, we will delete all recurring meetings that have more than two people. So not one-on and our internal people only. So not interviews or external partner meetings. And then we have a two-week moratorium where you’re not allowed to add a reoccurring meeting. You can have a regular meeting, but not a reoccurring meeting. And the idea is that there’s a lot of inertia behind a recurring meeting. It just always is there and you know what’s coming up. And it’s hard to delete because you’re like, oh yeah, we talk about this thing every week. And so what we do is we kind of just do a meeting reset. And I think, yeah, it’s just called Chaos Monkey and the admins go in and just delete everything. ([Time 0:37:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/caeab788-4cd3-4954-b0c6-479d3f663612))
- **Deleting Code**
  - Farhan Thawar championed deleting over a million lines of code at Shopify.
  - He prioritizes code elegance and simplicity over volume.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  Interesting and it makes sense that so much of the way you all think is about building the best possible platform versus the necessarily best possible like point solution for someone. And it also explains why you spend so much time in crafting really great code and pair programming, because again, it’s a platform for other people to build stuff on. So I think a lot of this is very useful, especially for platform businesses.
  Farhan Thawar
  No, exactly. And actually, you’re making me think of a stat. So last year, I tweeted out, you know, maybe a tangent, but I tweeted out that GitHub Copilot has written over 1 million lines of code for Shopify. And people are like, oh, my God, and it got like picked up. And everyone’s talking about it. And I go, I don’t know why is everybody getting so crazy? Because what I want to see is GitHub Copilot deleting 1 million lines of code. Like that’s when you know, we’re actually at this point where this is close to an engineer, right? And so we famously have deleted millions of lines of code this year, because we’re trying to focus on the again, the sunk cost and like rebuilding things elegantly, or you don’t need This anymore and rebuilding. And I even tweeted out, I think someone said, Oh, Shopify is in the top 10 Ruby code bases in the world. And I said, I never want to see us on this list again. Like, it’s not like we shouldn’t be gunning for number one. We should be gunning for number 100, right? Like we want to be not on this list, right? Someone else can take ([Time 0:45:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/95f0e29a-5487-4812-b0fb-8eebbea0840f))
- **Categorizing Development Work**
  - Categorize development work into experiments, features, or infrastructure.
  - Prioritize building infrastructure that enables faster feature development.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  Love this in part because it connects to the topic we’re talking about, which is speed, velocity, intensity, smaller code base, cleaner, better code base allows you to move faster. I used to be an engineer actually, but both my engineering brain and my PM brain, like I love the idea of, you know, killing stuff that’s useless, fixing, making code cleaner and better And more durable. In reality, very hard for companies to prioritize this kind of thing. Is there anything you found that helps you do that? You mentioned hack days and weeks or one part of that probably helps that Toby’s an engineer and he understands the value of this kind of stuff. But I guess for folks that want to do this more, any advice?
  Farhan Thawar
  Yeah, so we, I mean, we actually think about when we’re building something, we think of it in one of three buckets. We’re like, are you building an experiment, a feature or infrastructure? And once you bucket things, you can say, oh, it’s an experiment. You’re like, cool, this is not infra. This is like we’re trying something to learn. And it might turn, by the way, that might turn into an experiment or infra, but it starts off as an experiment. Now, if you’re building a feature, a feature is basically you’re taking advantage of an existing piece of infra, right? So token gating is the example I gave. If you could now build that in one hour, you would probably say, oh, we have the right infra below it. But if you did what Toby does, which is he’s like, here’s the infra I wish existed. Here’s the feature. The feature might be quick to build, but now I have to go and build the infra. You’re now slotting yourself into infra land, which is like that could take longer. But you’re now enabling it for a bunch of use cases. You don’t have to think about it at once because you may have people using your API in a different way. So I think you kind of have to slot yourself. Now, how do people get into this mode? It is super, super hard. And I would say, like, Toby is the secret sauce here because he pushes us to think about things as infra almost all the time. I mean, one of the things that annoys me the most probably is that I’ll always come to him and say, hey, we can do A or B. And he looks at me and he goes, you know what I’m going to say, right? I’m like, you’re going to say, go back and generate more options. Because he doesn’t like those. I don’t like A or B. Come back when you have something else, right? He has, he actually, maybe I’ll tell you a little anecdote. He has a story where he says, there are unlimited amount of wrong options for any problem. There’s probably 10,000 right options, but everybody stops at the first right one. Instead, what you should be spending all your time on, because the options that don’t work, you’re not going to spend time on. But you have to figure out which of the 10,000 options is the right one and spend time in that. What are all these right options? Don’t just stop at the first one. And so when I come to and say A or B, I’m picking two of the 10,000. And like he’s like, that’s not what I go back and generate more options because those are not the optimal ones. So he is like quite, you know, the philosopher on these things. And it does really change the way the company works because he’ll push you on these things. And then we over time learn to spot the same patterns. And I learned to push my team on infra and deleting code and making things simple. Because by the way, who doesn’t want to get free stuff, right? Like free performance, free, easy to navigate code base, free maintainability, free resiliency, because now we went and did the hard work of deleting. It is hard, but that goes back to the beginning, right? Like choose the hard thing. Don’t just build the feature, go make the feature easy to build.

- **Interviews are Bad Predictors**
  - Interviews are not reliable performance predictors.
  - Use job trials and internships for realistic performance assessment.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  Across. Choosing the harder paths, I might say. Okay, let’s talk about hiring. You have some really interesting takes on hiring. One that I’ve heard about is that you kind of don’t like the interview process. You kind of like to prefer not to interview and do something instead. Talk about that.
  Farhan Thawar
  Yeah, so throughout my career, what I’ve noticed is that, and I’m sure everybody, this is a dirty little secret, right? Interviews are not a good predictor of performance. We know this. We know this from studies. We know this. Everyone at their company knows this, where like somebody interviewed well, wasn’t as good in the job or the opposite, didn’t interview well and then came in and was phenomenal. Right before we came to Shopify was I hired two people for machine learning. One was like a PhD, taught at the university, was like, oh my God, no brainer. It was also recommended by an employee. We’re like, oh my God, this person’s going to be great. The other person was like a dude I met at the coffee shop who had never had a software job, but was like just so interested in machine learning. And person A, we let go within a few weeks because like not a fit for a culture. And person B is still, was at our startup and is still at Shopify today. And is a phenomenal machine learning engineer who literally at our Christmas party was like, you know, this is my first software job, right? We’re like, how? But it was just so cute. Like, and we gave them both a shot. Like the key was, I didn’t use the resume in either way to bias. We brought them both in. We said, here’s the environment we had. It was all pair programming at my startup. And so they pair program. And, you know, actually, as an aside, you know, I care. I really believe in pair programming when I made with my I made people work in pair program with my own money. Like I paid people to have I paid for two people to be on one computer. So that’s how you don’t have the code.
  Lenny Rachitsky
  Yeah, exactly.
  Farhan Thawar
  Right. Less than half the code. But anyway, so pairing and they, and it was pretty clear after just a few weeks. I would say, let’s say up to three months is like the amount of time I give people that person A wasn’t going to work out and person B was. So what I really like to do is use this like race car analogy. If I told you, hey, I want to go hire the best race car driver. There’s not really that many questions you could ask them except for like put them in the car. And so the same thing happens with us is that of course we have to do interviews, but we do really spend time in the 30, 60, 90 days to make sure that the thing that they are bringing actually Lines up with what we need at Shopify. And you should also be transparent with people because if it’s not a fit, it’s actually good for them and you to figure that out as quickly as possible because they could be amazing somewhere Else, right? Like we mentioned like the chaotic environment and fast moving environment Shopify is that’s not for everyone, but that’s okay, right? We’re not looking for, right? We’ve talked about that. We want to be as, you know, the best 10,000 person company in the world. We’re not looking for like millions of people. We just need the best 10,000. And so if it’s not a fit, like it’s in your interest and our interest to figure that out quickly so that you can go somewhere where you will be amazing. And for us to have the people who will be amazing at Shopify. And so job trials, I’m a huge fan of, which leads me to like intern programs. What a great interview process because you now have real work product from somebody for four months. They get to see what it’s like to be at Shopify for four months. We get to see what it’s like for them to be at Shopify for four months. And that can turn into a full-time gig. And that’s a great interview process because you literally know exactly. You don’t have to, I’ll give you a funny example. I think I’ve heard a company where like, oh, we have an intern process. And then afterwards we interview them for full-time. I’m like, what are you going to learn like, let’s say even eight hours of interviews that you’re not going to have learned from four months of real work experience? Like, and so there’s just things like that. You just got to look at the work product. And so I’m a big fan of like job trials. And in my previous companies, I almost, like you mentioned, I almost didn’t interview anybody. I almost just said, come in and work. And it allowed us, we had a much higher, like in the first 90 days, like 20% attrition before 90 days, because it just didn’t work out. But those after 90 days, we had less than 1% attrition because they knew exactly what they’re getting into. And we knew exactly how they were going to fit.

- **Internship Program as Job Trials**
  - Shopify’s 2025 goal is to hire 1,000 interns as large-scale job trials.
  - Interns provide valuable perspectives and potential future hires.
  Transcript:
  Farhan Thawar
  Yeah, I would love to do. It’s hard to do with the volume of resumes we get, but we do do it at scale with the internship program, right? So like 2025, we’re going to hire a thousand interns. And like, that is going to give me a thousand job trials to pick like the top, you know, X percent of those to come to Shopify full time. Yeah.
  Lenny Rachitsky
  So just to double click on that. So you’re hiring a thousand interns. Yes. Over the course of the year. That’s a lot. And the idea there is these folks are actually useful, building useful things. And it’s an interview process for. Yeah, I mean, I think it’s two things.
  Farhan Thawar
  One is, is some people look at an internship program as like community service. Like, let’s give back to the community. Let’s hire early talent. And I’m like, hold on a sec. Are you telling me I could hire a thousand people over the year and they will come to work with an LLM and a brain because they’re growing up in the age of AI. They will be useful to us because they come from a different generation and they have like in our case in commerce, they have a different experience about shopping and AI and bots and Chat and voice and like all these things. They’ll be useful to us. We’ll teach them some stuff as well. And then together we can decide if they, you know, they might end up going somewhere else, in which case we have the Shopify imprint on them going to whatever other company, which is, I think, a positive, or they might stay at Shopify and be useful over a longer period. Like, it seems like like win, win, win. The other thing that was cool is after I did that tweet, a bunch of other CTOs messaged me and said, hey, we’re going to hire a thousand one interns to beat you guys. And I’m like, great. Like if we that one tweet, if I can get the early talent ecosystem restarted here after a really tough last few years and layoffs, it’s great for everybody because now they’re realizing That they also realize that these people are super valuable and they bring together a completely different set of skills. And by the way, here’s a secret. In pair programming, interns will always be more intense than the full time. And so that also helps the flywheel of intensity go.
  Lenny Rachitsky
  It all just keeps coming back. Did the internship program emerge out of this co-op system that Canadian schools have? I know Waterloo has a big co-op program.
  Farhan Thawar
  Yeah, I went to Waterloo. And so yeah, hint, hint. So I went to Waterloo. And I did my I did co-op and I did intern programs there. It was amazing. What a great experience, because what ends up happening is you leave Waterloo with your degree, but also with two years of experience, because I did six four month work terms, 24 months. And you end up walking. I mean, I think one of the big parts of it is just interview skills because I interviewed for 10 plus jobs every, uh, every four months. And I did that six times. And so you come out having done lots, you have a lot of interview experience, but you also have work experience. And so just taking that to the next level, Shopify has always had interns. And what I felt like we needed to do was again, restart this notion of, uh, of early talent in the ecosystem. There is, I would say, one or two big differences with our intern program. One is we’re making them come in three days a week versus full remote. And the reason for that is early, and we’re doing it just in three offices right now, Montreal, Toronto, and Ottawa. And the reason for that is because we want them to have a cohort because early talent is different than, you know, you and I who’ve been in the industry. We worked in office. We worked out of office. We’re more comfortable with navigating like partnership discussions and like talking to people in different companies. But these people have not. They maybe have never worked anywhere. And so to not have the IRL component would do them a disservice. And so we specifically made it in those ports. And the people are traveling, by the way, like they’re like moving to Montreal to do the internship. It’s great. And then if you’re a mentor or manager for one of the interns, you have to at least see them like IRL once a month. So we’re kind of making these experiences. And of course, they’ll have a cohort of dozens of people that will be with them along the way. And so we think that’ll just make their experience better. And of course, nothing like tapping someone on the shoulder and be like, have you seen this era before? And so it’s easier in an early talent situation. And then of course, over time, if they become full-time, they can still come to the office, right? It’s come if you want, but they can also go full remote.

- **Managing 120 Direct Reports**
  - Farhan Thawar once managed 120 direct reports, prioritizing unscheduled one-on-ones.
  - This approach aimed to unblock individuals when needed.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  And there’s a whole bunch of stuff we can talk about. One fact I heard while you were there is you had a hundred reports, direct reports that reported to you. 120. 120 direct reports feels like a complete nightmare to me. Tell me why you decided to do that if you’d recommend that for other people.
  Farhan Thawar
  Yeah. So what ended up happening there was we started off small, right? It was 10 people when I got to Extreme Labs. I wasn’t the founder, but I was very early on. And I just had everyone report to me. And then as we grew, I just kept having those people report to me. And I was trying to figure out, like, you know, we talked about like crafters and crafters paradise, this idea of like, people don’t really like they, there’s managers are useful. But I was trying to figure out, could I solve the problems that they were, they needed their manager for in other ways. So for example, what should I be working on? I was like, okay, well, we have product backlogs, or I’m blocked on something, or I need feedback on the product I’m building, or I’m stuck on this technical problem. I tried to figure out ways to not have managers with the answers to those questions. I’m like, there should be another answer. And so pair programming really helps you get unblocked quickly because you have another person that you can bounce technical ideas off of. Having a product backlog can tell you what to work on. We had demos every week, demos internally. And we had demos with the clients every week because we were contract manufacturing for mobile. That gave them feedback on whether they were going in the right direction. We had set working hours, which made things super intense in the office. This is again, like 2009 to 2013. So all these things didn’t really need a manager. And what I realized was what the unblocking thing needed a manager. I’m blocked on this. Well, I said, okay, if I did have all these directors, I did two things famously. One, I had a lot of direct reports and two, I did not do any scheduled one-on because you can’t have 120 direct reports and do scheduled one-on because you’re never doing anything but One-on So I said, I’m going to be around a lot because I don’t have a lot of one-on So we can do unscheduled one-on And what that means is if you are blocked, actually there’s a famous picture Where I had this weird cube desk where it was like a circle almost in the middle of the whole floor of engineers. And I was always there because I wasn’t in a lot of meetings and people, if they were blocked, they could just come up to me. Right. The cool, actually one cool thing about pair programming IRL is you can kind of look across and just see if it’s working or not. Because if two people are intensely on the computer, you know, it’s working. If one person is laying back or like, you’re like, it’s not working. So you could just walk up to them and be like, what’s happening? But they would, they would come and ask me questions and I could unblock them. Like, Hey, we’re blocked on this. We don’t have this API. We need money for this machine, like whatever. And so the unscheduled one-on ended up being like a real clarifying thing for me because I did scheduled one-on my whole career. And I realized after leaving like Microsoft for three years, I’m like, we’re all those one-on useful, right? Once a week for three years, right? 150 one-on So the unscheduled ones were though. I was like, when I knocked on my manager’s door and said, I have this problem, those were important. So that’s what I created at Xtreme. And the 120 direct, it just grew over time. I just didn’t think I needed managers. I was like, let me unblock these people in another way. And we came up with other things to systems to unblock them that didn’t require a manager. And I just also had a good memory. I knew exactly everyone’s skills and compensation and all that off the top of my head. So that helps. The other thing that broke was, actually, this is Chamath. He came in and became our biggest investors. And he actually, he’s obviously a smart guy. But he said the right thing, which is not, this can never work, because then I would go into defense mode and explain to him why it would work. He just said to me, I’m not going to debate with you whether this works or not. But will it work at 400 people? And I said, probably not. He said, OK, so let’s change it. And so we did then end up putting a little bit more of a structure. But I made a few people directors and I forced them to have 40 direct reports each. Like I said, we’re just going to make it still pretty flat. And then that did end up working because it still allowed them to be, use the system to unblock people versus like having to do a one-on every week or having to, you know, talk about things That potentially a system could unblock. And so I tried to figure out ways to systematize things.
  Lenny Rachitsky
  I love it. Just another example of doing things differently, not necessarily just here’s how it’s done and I’m going to do it that way and experimenting with it. Even if you knew like, okay, maybe long-term, this isn’t the way it’s going to operate. Imagine at Shopify you’re not you don’t have 120 reports.
  Farhan Thawar
  No I have like we have the F14 or something right like we do we do have like these guardrails where I think we say hey like in engineering you should have between eight and like 20. There are definitely people who have more and people who have less but we do try to keep things as flat as possible because we do believe that like, it doesn’t make sense to have like three People reporting to somebody and then they only have three people. So like, you just make a very deep hierarchy. We actually do see, by the way, the farther you are from Toby, the, like we can see things in like the survey results, like the alignment gets out of whack. And so you do actually see that you want to be closer. You want to have a flatter org in general. And that can be achieved by just having more direct reports per level.

- **React Native Decision**
  - Farhan Thawar’s early decision at Shopify to hedge on React Native for Android cost 18 months of engineering time.
  - Toby Lutke encouraged risk-taking, even if it leads to failure.
  Transcript:
  Lenny Rachitsky
  Here’s all the things that I’ve done right. Here’s all the big wins. And everyone feels like, oh man, I wish I was always successful like these people. When in reality, everyone that comes on has failed many times. Is there a story of a failure in your career that you could share that helps people see that even folks like you fail and maybe what you learned from that experience?
  Farhan Thawar
  I have a few. I’ll say one thing, by the way, because I think I read this in Tim Ferriss’s book or on the podcast where he said, create a failure resume and write everything down. And I would not recommend doing this because I did this and I got super… I’m like a high energy, happy guy. I wrote down… I have a note on my phone called failure resume and wrote down all the times I failed. And it is depressing. So I would not encourage people to do that, but I’m happy to tell you about a few, a few instances. So, well, one is actually I’ve been laid off twice. And people would not expect like, oh, like, you know, I’m doing this thing. And like, I’ve been laid off twice. And, you know, I think in both times, it was the right thing. Like, it was the right thing for the company, the right thing for me. And I kind of use that experience as like a way to reevaluate and eventually came up with my framework of how I want to spend time. But that’s maybe a different story. I’ll tell you about one at Shopify. The first week that I started, 2019, we were rebuilding our point of sale system, which now does like billions of dollars of GMB. But back then we were like, let’s rebuild it with a new UX and a new technology platform. And it was my first week and I’m the mobile guy coming from Extreme Labs. They’re like, should we build this in React Native? Or should we build this natively on mobile platforms? And so I went through this evaluation, spent a lot of time, blah, blah, blah. And I came back with a hedged solution, which is kind of dumb. I said, let’s do iOS and Swift and let’s do Android and React Native. And the reason I said that was I said, I want to learn about React Native. And I think Android is the harder platform. So let’s build that in React Native. But iOS on Swift, because that guarantees us a product in market. And we didn’t have any React Native apps in market at the time. A year later, we launched the iOS version. And it was a huge success. And we then spent like another six months building the React Native version for Android and everything else. And we realized pretty quickly that React Native was the platform for the future. Like we’re like, oh my God, this will allow us to have one platform. You could run it on the web as well. And we could use the React engineers from the web to work on it. Like it was like a clear winner. And by then we had also launched the shop app, which is React Native. And so we learned a lot about this. And I went back and I said, hey, everybody, I made a huge mistake. We just spent a year building this thing. It’s in market, but we’re going to have to rewrite. We’re going to have to rebase back onto this iOS version. I think I burned 18 months of time with like 100 engineers, like literally from the decision I made in the first week of joining Shopify. And Toby, when I went to Toby and I told him, I go, Hey man, I think I made this mistake and we have to do this. And it’s going to cost us like, you know, a hundred engineers, another six, whatever. And he looked at me and he goes, you should tell everyone this story. That’s all he said. Not like, Hey, bad, good. Like he goes, did you learn something? Like it was, it was like a, it was an epiphany for me, but he was like, this is a learning org. And I totally failed. I told everyone I failed and my mistake and everything else. But he goes, just tell everyone because he goes, do you know what mistake you made? And first I was like, I don’t think I like what mistake he’s like, you didn’t take. He goes, I will, I will always come down harshly on people who do not take risks. And you did not take a risk in this case. But if you make a, if you take a risk and you, and it doesn’t work out, you’ll never get in trouble because you took the risk and it was the right risk to take. But he goes, but you didn’t take the risk. And so what I should have done, and by the way, even now thinking back, it would be super hard to do. First week of job buy, right? Is like, take a risk on a platform that we have not launched in production app on, but he was correct in that we should have because we would have saved ourselves so much more time. And so, yeah, total failure. Sorry, the product is like super successful now. And like, we’re all on React Native. And even the shop green app is on React Native. Everything’s React Native. And we’re like core contributors. Like, it’s all good. But I literally burned, I think, 18 months of time for 100 engineers as my first decision in the company.
  Lenny Rachitsky
  This might be the best example of failure coordinator we’ve had yet. This is a great example. Both of them actually are. Although I’m wondering, like, okay, that felt like a really good decision to me. And it sounds like it, right? But it wouldn’t have been his.
