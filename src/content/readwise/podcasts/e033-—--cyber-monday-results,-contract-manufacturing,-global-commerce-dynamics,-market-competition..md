  - Birds fly in a V formation to take turns doing the hard work

  Speaker 2
  Dude, I think that is a good observation that the Black Friday shopper tends to not be a gift giver. It depends on who your demographic is. Like if you’re selling to men, the gift giver shopper is going to walk into Target on December 23rd.
  Speaker 4
  That’s exactly right.
  Speaker 1
  That’s exactly right.
  Speaker 2
  They’re not thinking ahead at all. All right, going back to the point of this episode, we just wanted to give a little more context into two important ideas we’ve been talking about. So Mike tweeted something. I’ll be on the screen right here that it’s way better to be in an industry with competitors. And you and I share the same opinion, but we should really expand on this. We both talked about it slightly. But can you talk and explain why a competitor is the best thing that can happen to your brand?
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, so think about it to use an analogy here. Let’s think about it like birds. Birds fly in these. And the reason that they fly in these that we’ve learned when we’re a kid is because that allows for one bird to be kind of the lead bird and to do the hardest work and other birds to kind of Draft off that. But then they trade, right? Like one bird goes from the back of the V to the front of the V and does the heavy lifting for a while.

- Allocation, Government Contracts, and the Gap in Manufacturing
  Key takeaways:
  - Allocation for manufacturing in the US is determined by the need for business, government contracts, and cost considerations.
  - Benchmade manufactures its own products and many companies in the US focus on self-production.
  - China’s manufacturing industry contributes to a significant portion of its GDP.
  - The US and China have a similar dollar value of goods produced, although the US economy is larger overall.
  - Manufacturing in the US is focused on self-production rather than producing goods for other companies.

  Speaker 2
  They’re going to give me allocation for 500. It’s because they don’t need our business. Like they have government contracts, they have everything else going on. And they know that the cost to spin up a new contract knife manufacturer, who the fuck would want to do that? Right? Benchmade made it themselves so they could sell their own stuff. And that’s, you know, the number I have is 12% of the US GDP is manufacturing. So it’s $2.3 trillion. In China, it's 27%. So let's see what China GDP is. It's, you know, roughly the same amount of dollar value as being created in China as United States. Our economy is 50% bigger. You know, there's 27% worth 12%. It's within a stone's throw. Maybe $4 trillion worth of goods are produced in China. So it’s not that crazy. Like we still do a ton of manufacturing here. But a lot of it is bowing making plans for themselves or for making cars for themselves or Benchmade making knives for themselves. I can’t go to Ford and be like, Hey, will you make? Yeah, will you make wallets for me? So it’s this big fucking gap. There’s still a bunch of stuff being made here, but it’s being made for themselves. Right? So if you ever want manufacturing to come back to America in spades, right? ([Time 0:25:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/47b09ac6-0c16-41e4-934f-a4137045a50e))
- Reasons for Vertical Integration and Regulatory Compliance at Ridge
  Key takeaways:
  - Vertical integration has been the right decision for Ridge due to several factors including regulatory requirements and the need to show commitment to the US economy.
  - Expanding manufacturing footprint helps Ridge demonstrate itself as a domestic business and improves enforcement of intellectual property in China.
  - Investing in the US economy was requested by the US government.
  - Private operations form the second bucket of reasons for vertical integration.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Give us, give us the, give us the reason why vertical integration you feel like has been the right, is the right decision for Ridge. Because I always think that’s helpful when we unpack for people. Hey, here’s why this is a win. Because, you know, why not spend more time on product development or marketing or whatever else? Why, why for you has vertically integrating made sense.
  Speaker 2
  So you can put them in a couple buckets. And you could debate which one of these buckets is the biggest. I probably put them in four buckets. The first is, I’ll just get out of the way. There’s a regulatory aspect. So we want to invest inside the US economy. We want to invest in US labor. We want to do all these types of things to show to the US government that we are a serious US company. So one of the quickest and easiest way to do that is to expand our manufacturing footprint. So we met with regulators and different people and we’re like, Hey, we have a knock off problem in China. How can we get better enforcement of our IP? They’re like, show us that you’re a domestic business. So we did that. So that’s the first regulatory bucket. I’ve been open about that. We went through an ITC thing. That’s definitely the US government asked me to invest in the US economy and I did it. The second bucket is private ([Time 0:32:35](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cc489dfa-2a14-45d6-bbd3-9b0b49f9d45c))

- Reasons for Expanding Manufacturing Footprint and Owning Manufacturing
  Key takeaways:
  - There are four main buckets to consider when investing in the US economy and showing commitment as a domestic business.
  - Regulatory compliance is one bucket that involves expanding manufacturing to demonstrate a serious US company.
  - Private equity groups are hesitant to invest in China-dependent businesses due to political instability and potential shipping disruptions.
  - Companies should prioritize owning and being experts in what they do, such as manufacturing.

That’s definitely the US government asked me to invest in the US economy and I did it. The second bucket is private equity groups are very hesitant to invest in China dependent businesses right now. Because if you’re just a Shopify account or Amazon account and everything’s done abroad, it’s like, what are they buying? Like, what if China stops shipping your thing? COVID was really, really scary. Like there is political instability. Wall Street doesn’t want China dependent businesses right now. So that is the second bucket. The third bucket is companies should own what they do. Right? Like I’ve said that forever. What’s the most important thing about your business? You need to own that. For a long time, it was digital marketing. I was against agencies because what the fuck do you think you are? You are an Alibaba product. You got to get good digital marketing. We already own digital marketing. The next piece of that is we just have to own our manufacturing. It’s like at the end of the day, we make stuff. We have to make stuff for a living. We need to know how that works and be experts at it. ([Time 0:32:56](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ab4ec528-f7a6-49fb-a8fc-cb9458ad4583))
