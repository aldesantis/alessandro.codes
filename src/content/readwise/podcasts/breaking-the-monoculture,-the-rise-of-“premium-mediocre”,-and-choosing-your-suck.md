  - Modern culture is becoming “jazzified,” fragmenting into niche subcultures.
  - Fans age with their chosen subcultures, unlike the past’s shifting monoculture.

  Mark Manson
  I’ve got a theory, Drew, and it starts with music, but I think it kind of explains everything. Everything. Everything. Ever. Okay, not everything, but most, a lot of things. Bear with me. We haven’t got the brilliant or bullshit yet. We just started. We just started. Just started. It’s the Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck podcast with your host, Mark Manson. I’ve actually, I’ve gone to a number of concerts recently. One of them was a metal show. So I’m a big fan of a band called Lamb of God. Shout out to Randy, the lead singer. He’s a fan of mine. I’m a fan of his. He was cool enough to invite me out to his show, got to hang out with him and everything. It was fun. You know, I was a big metal head when I was young and it was interesting going back. I hadn’t been to a metal show in probably at least six, seven years. And it was interesting going to a metal show again. I’m in my forties. Most of the audience was in their forties. Some in their fifties. The bands were all in their forties and fifties. Everybody was middle age. Everybody. Everybody looked like you could probably catch them driving a minivan and taking their kids to soccer practice during the week. And it was really interesting because I had a similar experience. I went to an electronic show maybe two or three weeks later. Same thing. It’s funny. That one I went to and I was a little bit insecure. I was like, oh, it’s going to be a bunch of kids on Molly and shit. And like, I’m probably too old for this. No, sure enough, like half the audience was probably at least my age. And they seem to be aging up. So here’s the theory. I think of it as the jazzification of everything. The jazzification of everything. The jazzification of everything. And And hear me out here. Okay. So when we were young, jazz was lame. Right. And I didn’t really develop an appreciation for jazz music until I went to music school and I was forced to study it. And then once I started studying it, I realized like, oh, this is really intricate and cool and creative. And there’s all this cool stuff going on. What I also learned at music school is that jazz was cool as fuck in the forties and fifties, thirties, forties, and fifties. In fact, fun fact, the word cool comes from jazz. It’s the invention of cool. There’s actually a Miles Davis album called the birth of cool anyway sidebar being a jazz fan as a young person in the 2000s it was incredibly lonely and isolating i would go to jazz shows First of all they’re in tiny clubs uh that held like maybe 50 60 people and it would be like me two other music dorks and then like a bunch of 60 and 70 year olds and it like, it was sad, especially Because the musicians were some of the best musicians I’d ever seen in my life. And it was this weird thing where like, okay, it had its cultural moment. And then rock happened and television happened and pop happened. And, you know, the mainstream culture just passed it by and kind of left it alone. But there was this very intense cult following these, this group of people that grew up with it and they never left it and they just loved it forever. And at the metal show, I was like, wow, metal is becoming like jazz. It’s becoming the next jazz. Right. And then I went to the electronic show and I was like, electronic feels like it’s kind of becoming the next jazz. And then I started thinking about every show I’ve been to and everything I’ve like, not just music wise, but like, uh, the video games that I’m into or the, you know, the movies and TV shows That I’m into, like every form of media and entertainment, there is a small group of super mega popular hits, right? You have like the Taylor Swift and the Mario and Fortnite and, you know, the big Marvel movie or whatever. But everything else is like jazz. Everything else is a small subculture of highly dedicated fans. Unlike in the 20th century, where everything was a monoculture. Everybody was watching the same five channels. So it was like, in the 70s, disco was in. And then in the 80s, disco’s out. Now everybody’s into rock and glam, you know, and then by the 90s, glam is out and everybody’s in the alternative. And everybody would kind of just jump ship to the next thing over and over. We don’t have a monoculture anymore. Has their own little jazz that they’re into almost exclusively from everybody else. And it’s their little subculture and you age together, right? Like I was a metal fan when I was 20. I went and saw Lamb of God. Now I’m 40. I went and saw Lamb of God. If they’re still playing when I’m 60, I’ll probably go see Lamb of God, right? Like it’s the, we age through together, the artists age with the fans and, uh, and it’s, it’s a completely different dynamic.

- **Phones at Concerts**
  - Mark Manson observed concertgoers’ phone usage habits.
  - People used their phones more during popular acts, detaching from the present moment.
  Transcript:
  Mark Manson
  Second thought. Here’s my fuck for the week. Been to a bunch of concerts recently. Yes. The fucking phones, dude. Oh, totally. It kills me. Here’s the thing I noticed. And this is what I want to talk about. I kind of understand because I do it a little bit, but I’m also just confused. It was very interesting going to a bunch of different shows. And like most concerts, you know, there’s a couple openers. And then there’s like the kind of the sub-headline act. And then there’s the big headline act. And it was interesting watching the people around me. Of course, fucking phones in the air all the time.
  Drew
  So fucking annoying.
  Mark Manson
  It was really interesting because in the super early opening acts that nobody had ever heard of them, you didn’t see any phones. No phones. Everybody’s actually watching the show and thinking about like, oh, that part was kind of good or like, oh, this song’s okay. As the acts got a little bit more popular and people got more into it, the phones started coming out more. And then by the time you got to the main headlining act, people just had phones in the air the entire When I went to the electronic show, the headliner was like a big name DJ. And there was a guy next to me who at some point I actually thought he was live streaming the show because his phone was out for a good 30 or 40 minutes straight. And finally, I kind of like craned my neck back and looked and it’s like, no, he was recording this video. Just a video. Yeah. Like, dude, you’re literally recording half the show. And to me, there’s like, there’s something paradoxical there of the more meaningful the moment, the more people remove themselves from the present moment by pulling out their phones. Yes. Which kind of makes no sense, but then it’s like also very consistent, like every concert or event I go to, this is what happens. The more meaningful the moment, the more everybody just whips out their phone and turns into a little filmmaker and removes themselves from experiencing the moment.

- **Experiencing vs. Capturing Moments**
  - Drew Burney realized taking a picture of a sunset diminished the experience.
  - He then put his phone away to enjoy the moment authentically.
  Transcript:
  Mark Manson
  Explain this to me. Help me out your truth.
  Drew
  Well, I don’t know. I don’t use my phone in that way but i do experience this in some different ways just very recently i was standing on my back porch and i have this there’s like this beautiful little hay Field across the street from my house and like a couple little mountains and stuff and it’s to the west so i get really pretty sunsets you know and i kind of glanced down i was like oh it’s Really pretty sunset tonight immediately grab my phone walk out on my back porch, take a picture, look at it. It sucks because it’s the picture, you know. Never captured it. And I just turn around and I walk inside. And then I got inside. I’m like, what the fuck am I doing? I’m going to go enjoy this sunset for real. And so I, you know, go back out and I enjoyed the sunset as it, as God intended it, as it were. And so, I mean, I, that’s a small little sliver of the same type of thing, but it is, you, you, you look at that screen after, you know, whatever it is, a concert or a sunset or whatever it Is. And it’s just never as good. Do you put the phone right back in your pocket and just walk away? Or do you sit down and, and enjoy it? That’s, that’s what I’ve trained myself to do is be like, ah, put the phone away and just enjoy this. ([Time 0:11:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8ea77a66-54b6-4b6b-8f05-deae8bbb608e))
- **Premium Mediocre**
  - “Premium mediocre” describes products/lifestyles appearing exclusive but offering superficial luxury.
  - This trend arose from millennials growing up in abundance, demanding perceived scarcity.
  Transcript:
  Mark Manson
  All right, we’re back. I’m excited for this brilliant or bullshit. Yeah, this was one that I put on the docket. This is an old, old theory. Well, it’s not that old, but probably 10 years old or something. In the internet age, it’s old. Yeah, by internet years, it’s quite old. An old blog called Ribbon Farm had an article about a concept called premium mediocre. And ever since I read about it, it’s one of those ideas that’s just stuck in my head ever since. And I probably never go more than six months without something happening in my life. And I’m like, oh, this is totally premium mediocre. So give us a brief synopsis of what it is. Yeah.
  Drew
  So Venkatesh Rao, he wrote the, I think that’s how he says his name, right? Venkatesh Rao? Is it Rao? Yeah. I think that’s how he says his name. He wrote this blog post in 2017 called Premium Mediocre. What premium mediocre is. It describes product services and lifestyles that appear exclusive but offer only superficial luxury or quality. Okay. So it has an irrelevant touch of premium that doesn’t really improve the essential mediocrity of the experience or product. Let me give you some examples. Okay. Some that he used anyway. Cupcakes and frozen yogurt. Like, okay. Truffle oil. That’s not made from real truffle. Okay.
  Mark Manson
  That’s a great example.
  Drew
  That’s a great example. He also uses avocado toast. Yep. That’s a special case, but it’s still premium mediocre. Certain types of lettuce. I thought that was great. Like, you know, obviously iceberg lettuce is not premium mediocre, but what’s the leafy green? I’m blanking completely on it.
  Mark Manson
  I have no idea. What’s that one kind of lettuce?
  Drew
  Yeah. You don’t eat vegetables.
  Mark Manson
  I don’t cook my own food.
  Drew
  Certain types of lettuce. Yeah. K-pop popularity in France. The list goes on and on. You’ve spot these things. Once you start, once you understand what premium mediocre is, you spot them.
  Mark Manson
  The thing I always think of is the pumpkin spice latte at Starbucks. Pumpkin spice latte is perfect. Right, because it’s like seasonal, it’s exclusive, it’s only available for a limited time, and it’s just a fucking commodity.
  Drew
  Like fast casual dining, like a lot of, you know, maybe Chipotle was like an early version of it. Right. You know, but now I don’t know if you ever go to Cava. Like, oh, I love Cava. It’s like this big chain restaurant that’s supposed to be a healthy Mediterranean food. Yeah. It’s premium.
  Mark Manson
  It goes on and on and on. So, but it’s a fun concept. He plays with it for a little while, but I love how the philosophical depth that he goes with it is really interesting because his explanation is actually really interesting, which Is that, you know, 100 years ago, 200 years ago, access to things was scarce, right? And so the way you improve society and the way you sold things and made money is that you just got access to things. It’s like, okay, we’ll go dig up the oil and we’ll sell it to you, or we’ll go, you know, mine the ore and we’ll sell it to you. Or we’ll grow the lettuce and sell it to you. At a certain point, there became an abundance of stuff. And I think his argument is that as the first generation that grew up within an abundance of stuff, that the first generation, the millennials in particular, who were no longer impressed By simple access to scarce things because there is no scarce thing. Millennials demanded something else that felt scarce and special. And so what companies started doing is they started essentially putting like luxurious packaging on boring commodities.
  Drew
  Mediocre products.
  Mark Manson
  Right. So it’s instead of just being a coffee with a little bit of pumpkin spice in it, it’s a exclusive seasonal pumpkin spice latte with an extra dollop of, you know, serve the way you want it, You know, because you deserve a special morning at Starbucks. Like all this- It’s got a little heart drawn in it.
  Drew
  Yeah.
  Mark Manson
  Your name’s on the cup like it’s the most premium mediocre thing in the world yeah it feels it is completely designed to feel like a special exclusive experience and it’s just that it’s A cup of mediocre coffee right and when you look around you see this all over the place you see it at sporting events you see it at VIP access to certain concert venues, you see it being a-
  Drew
  A premium economy seat on a plane.
  Mark Manson
  Yeah. Right? A premium economy. That’s a perfect example. That is the most premium, mediocre seat on an airplane. You see it in subscriptions to things like magazines, you know, you can get the, like the digital plus, which is essentially you’re just paying more to have a piece of paper sent to your Door. Like it’s the same thing you would have paid for anyway, but like, you know, they, they just add a plus at the end of it and send you a bunch of emails and you’re supposedly like having a more Premium experience.

- **Cynicism and Scarcity**
  - “Premium mediocre” products exploit the human craving for scarcity by creating a false sense of it.
  - This leads to cynicism as people recognize the disconnect between promised and actual value.
  Transcript:
  Mark Manson
  It’s, I think it’s, I think it is both the cause and the effect of a lot of the jadedness of the 21st century. It is the effect in the sense that humans crave scarcity because our perception of value is based on scarcity. Based on scarcity, of course. And so when most things in the world are no longer scarce, marketers, business people, they have to create a perception of scarcity. The problem is, is that people aren’t dumb. And on some level, you know that the pumpkin spice latte or the avocado toast or the digital plus subscription to the new york times uh there’s nothing premium about it it’s like the same Fucking thing just with a fancy name put on it and you there’s a certain amount of cynicism that develops right and he talks about that as well that there’s just like a deep the the most Defining quality of the millennial generation is their cynicism. And a lot of it is generated from this sense that everything is a little bit of a lie. Nothing is actually what was promised. Right.
  Drew
  We know it, but we’re also playing along at the same time too. Yeah, he puts that out as well.
  Mark Manson
  And it’s funny. Again, list goes on and on the premium mediocre vacations. It was funny. I was just in Spain on vacation and there are whole sections of Madrid and Barcelona and Ibiza that you might as well just put on Google maps, like circle it and put on like premium mediocre Tourist area. It’s like everything is designed to feel exclusive and special and catered just to you. And it’s like people are just herded through like cattle. And premium mediocre things tend to be overpriced. I think that’s another cause of the cynicism. Premium price on it, yeah. Yeah. Like there’s a disconnect between the promised value and the actual value right and i don’t know i just it’s one of those things i remember reading the article i loved it i was like wow That’s so clever and then as the years go on i just keep seeing it more and more and more i would argue we have premium mediocre politicians yeah um yeah Like you, again, back, if you go back And watch debates of like, I don’t know, Reagan and Bush or Clinton and Bush, you see very smart, educated, well-rehearsed men who clearly studied and thought deeply about policy and Can explain their policy positions and argue against each other’s policy positions coherently if you look at our politicians today it’s just a fucking word salad of emotions and essentially Just telling us that we’re special and they’re special and we’re all going to be special together because we’re all premium mediocre together. Um, yeah, I just, it feels, it feels ever present. Yeah. I would argue most media like Netflix, most Netflix shows are premium mediocre. Yeah. They are the same story regurgitated and new packaging that feels exclusive and special and unique, but it’s really just cliffhangers and hooks and audience manipulation.
  Drew
  And movie theaters, think about that, modern movie theaters. Yeah. Now they have these fancy seats and- Which aren’t really that fancy. They’re not that fancy, but they recline. You’re paying like $30 for it.
  Mark Manson
  Right, right, yeah. Yeah, definitely premium mediocre. We live in a premium mediocre world. Yeah, yeah. And I’m a premium mediocre girl. Yeah. In a mediocre world. Put that on my tombstone. ([Time 0:27:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/840a8692-5889-43be-80fa-ec872008c7eb))
- **Choosing Your Suck**
  - Everything in life has costs and benefits, including inaction.
  - Choose pursuits where perceived benefits outweigh costs, embracing your preferred “suck.”
  Transcript:
  Drew
  What’s our premium mediocre question of the day, Drew? This is a premium mediocre question for sure. Came in through YouTube as well. If everything we chase, like money, a partner, fame, has benefits and costs attached to it, why chase anything at all? It’s kind of a bullshit question, but I think it’s one we do need to answer, yeah.
  Mark Manson
  I mean, I get it. I mean, so this is something that I like to think of as the nihilist paradox, which is not caring about anything is still caring about something. Okay. Not chasing anything is chasing something. And you can’t really escape that. And so my answer to this question is like, yes, there are costs and benefits to pursuing anything in life. There’s also costs and benefits to not pursuing anything in life. So no matter where you go, there are costs and benefits. That’s just life. You can’t escape it. It is the fabric of our experience existence. So you might as well pick something. Right. Pick something that you think the benefits outweigh the costs. And it’s fun to get all philosophical and try to find a loophole here or there, but it doesn’t really work.
  Drew
  Yeah. Yeah. The drum you beat on too is you’re always going to have pain. Everything, there’s an associated suckage that comes with everything. Yes. Everything sitting around at home. You’ve said this before sitting around at home, doing nothing like you said, why tried anything? Well, that has cost to it. Yes. That’s real cost. You’re going to be in a lot of psychological pain from that and physical pain and your health is going to deteriorate. Working out at the gym though and eating right. That sucks too sometimes.
  Mark Manson
  Being lazy sucks. Working hard sucks. Being healthy sucks. Being unhealthy sucks. Like just choose the suck you want to have.
  Drew
  There’s better forms of suckage though is the point.
  Mark Manson
  Right. Choose the suck that you either think is worth it or you enjoy having because there is some suckage that you actually do enjoy having. Like there’s some, one of the ways I used to frame this question back in the day was what kind of masochist are you, right? Because there’s like every, everybody has something in their life that they kind of enjoy the pain of it. They kind of enjoy the struggle. And no matter what it is, like you have to figure out, out and then try to lean into it because that’s where your advantage is going to be. What’s the thing that most people can’t bear, but you don’t mind so much? Follow that.
  Drew
  Right. Do you think too, this kind of modern form of nihilism that we do see in a lot of places, is that also like its own form? It is its own form of avoidance too, right? Like we’ve just talked about earlier. Absolutely. This is also a form of avoidance. Oh, nothing matters. So I don’t have to try.
  Mark Manson
  Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It’s an excuse. It’s a very philosophical excuse. Yeah. It makes you feel smart it makes you feel very smart it makes you feel like nothing matters like you see see something that nobody else sees but here’s the thing is is if if if nothing matters So why do do anything you could also say nothing matters so why not do anything right right like if nothing matters do everything do everything yeah like go go accomplish all the things That you want to accomplish. Like go take all the risks, try all the things, build the stuff, talk to the people. Like there’s no reason not to either. So you ([Time 0:38:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7f3281fb-7027-410f-b4a6-cccd81a78b3d))
