## Highlights
- **Change Please Origin**
  - Chris Baker co-founded Change Please after witnessing people ignore a homeless person then buy expensive coffee.
  - This sparked the idea of using coffee to address homelessness by training individuals as baristas.
  Transcript:
  Nick Hague
  Yeah so you just mentioned change please coffee and i think that's worth digging into in a bit more detail as it's it's just a great story of how an idea can evolve i think you were sat there In a meeting weren't you and you know you could uh you people visiting a local coffee shop. Can you tell our listeners how it all went?
  Chris Baker
  It was a rare moment between meetings in the sort of hustle and bustle of Adland. And sat in a coffee shop in Covent Garden. There was a homeless guy sat at the front and you just saw numerous people just walking past. You know, they're looking at their phone. They're saying they had no change. Some of them are crossing the road to avoid him. But a lot of them are then walking into the coffee shop and spending three, four quid on a skinny latte and a chocolate croissant or whatever. So that was a bit of a light bulb moment and went, oh, hang on. There's something a bit broken in this journey what if we could use coffee um to help tackle homelessness and that's that's where the idea started um this thought of could we give people Experiencing homelessness an opportunity to train as a barista um give them a skill give them some confidence give them a wage and all of those things. And that's where it all came from. We took the idea initially to the big issue, who went, look, we love it, but we're a magazine publisher. We don't know anything about coffee. And I was living in Peckham at the time, South London. A total moment of serendipity. A couple of guys, Jamal Ezel, who's now CEO of change please and has been a total force of nature for the last decade and rich robinson were basically building this coffee roastery that Was working with people experiencing homelessness and we got all the all kind of all different parts together and then launched the brand um and you know trying to change please as a As an expression just works really nicely in terms of you know asking for change but also linking it really nicely into homelessness yeah ([Time 0:04:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5806366c-f3c9-4b5c-a372-e55844f8ca21))
- **Partnerships**
  - Partner with seemingly competitive brands for mutual benefit.
  - Change Please partnered with Nespresso, expanding their reach while Nespresso bolstered their social image.
  Transcript:
  Chris Baker
  Yeah, I'm sure it is. It's fantastic what you're doing there. And then the other thing is the partnership approach that Change Please have taken, working with lots and lots of big corporates. So the coffee is supplied into the likes of Google, WeWork, Virgin Atlantic, Delta Airlines, David Lloyd Gyms, and Nespresso is a new partnership started this year. And it's quite an interesting one because you wouldn't expect two coffee brands to partner because arguably they're competing, but actually Nespresso have seen it as a way to bolster Their credentials. You know, and for Change Please, it's a way to tap into the millions of Nespresso machines around the world. So it's a real win-win for both brands. Yeah. Interesting thing to see.

- **Serious Tissues Origin**
  - Chris Baker co-founded Serious Tissues out of concern for climate change and unsustainable toilet paper production.
  - Serious Tissues uses recycled paper, is plastic-free, and plants trees, contrasting with traditional brands cutting down trees.
  Transcript:
  Nick Hague
  So that was set up or, you know, the initial idea was 2015. And then four years later, you created Serious Tissues. So how did this come about? What's different about Serious Tissues to say the household names we know like Andrex Tissues?
  Chris Baker
  Yeah, so we, I suppose we had the success with Change Please and working with the same guys, working with Jamal, working with Rich and working with Martin who's a creative director I'd Worked with previously. Between the four of us, at the time we had eight kids, we've now got nine, and we're becoming increasingly concerned about climate change, about the world we're going to see in 20 years' Time when our kids get to adulthood. So we wanted to do something to tackle climate change. We saw that there's a big big problem in the in the paper sector so um the vast majority of toilet roll used in in the uk is toilet roll made from virgin pulp which is trees that have grown 20 30 years that are then cut down to make toilet roll and and when we need trees more than ever to fight climate change it seems like madness to be down to wipe our bums really um so we then Thought okay this is there's a problem in climate change there's a problem in the category of toilet paper and wider household paper and we wanted to so we created a toilet roll business Um the world has serious issues we created serious tissues um and it would be a toilet roll brand that was made from 100% recycled paper plastic free um uk made so you're not shipping it From halfway around the world like like bamboo products um and we plant trees with every sale so it's a toilet roll brand that plants trees rather than cutting them down. And we're now coming up to 1.5 million trees planted in about four and a half years. So, and really starting to build momentum now, particularly in the corporate world, which is interesting. Yeah, yeah. ([Time 0:08:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9cc4f3f6-ac1e-4788-a3c1-49162183db57))
- **Change Brand Examples**
  - Tony's Chocolonely tackles child slavery in cocoa production with a positive brand image and unique chocolate shapes.
  - Other change brands like Wild and Fussy offer refillable deodorants, combating plastic waste in landfills.
  Transcript:
  Nick Hague
  Yeah, absolutely.
  Chris Baker
  I mean, first and foremost, it just feels like a huge opportunity. In almost any category, there is a problem with the status quo, whether that's unhealthy ingredients, whether that's plastic packaging or whatever it might be, there is a problem. And there are also so many problems in the world that people increasingly care about because the world needs fixing, right? So brands can do that and doing it in a way that feels more like a sustainable business model than a charity. Again, you're self-funding rather than relying on donations. So I think the model is really interesting. I think there's numerous examples. One of the ones probably most high profile that I talk about in the book is Tony's Chocolonely. Originally created by journalists in in the netherlands um tackling exploitation and slavery of children in the cocoa supply chain so the vast majority of chocolate has children Working in fields whether that's clearing fields with machetes or spraying fertilizer um tonies have cut that down they've got their own supply chain now where there's a very very Small proportion of children working on their plantations I think it's down the industry averages 46% of children living on cocoa plantations end up working the within Tony's it's Down to under 4% in just in just four years so it's it's incredible as a model the brand is amazing the chocolate's incredible the way they um the way they tell the story across everything From the shape of the chocolate through to the advent calendar is genius so it's a very cool brand very joyous and positive so you want to be part of it rather than it being a charity chocolate Because it doesn't sound very tasty I mean similarly with with change please um some early thoughts were you know calling it things like street coffee and it just you don't want to soften You want it to feel like a a coffee brand that's going to taste amazing and feel quite specialty and high end you don't want to weaken it with perception around charity or all that sort Of things um so that's been important i think the i really like that there's a couple of deodorant brands um that are doing really well um uh both wild wild and fussy um what they basically Every single can of deodorant you've had in your life is probably still in existence somewhere in a in a landfill because it's either plastic or or aluminium and almost impossible to Recycle um what they've got is effectively a refillable compostable stick um natural really healthy for you as well but just means that you're not chucking your your deodorant roll On away every time so saving tons and tons of plastic you know it's a huge sector that 95 people use every every single day um and then i suppose the other one that i think is almost a bit of An accidental change brand um which my wife absolutely loves is is vintage um so you know it came to life in um in eastern europe from a founder um who basically had too many items of clothing In her wardrobe, was moving to university, needed to sell some. So she just set up the site and it went gangbusters almost immediately across Eastern Europe, across Germany. And since then, it's just obviously Vinted is now a household name and absolutely enormous. But their messaging now has shifted much more towards sustainability there's there's a crazy stats about the amount of clothes that are going into landfill i think there's enough Clothes already in circulation to clothe like the next five generations of humans which is just totally mind mind-boggling and there's there's other stats in the book that i around The size of this you know it's it's like four or five mount everests of clothes going into landfill every every couple of minutes so it's it's absolutely insane the scale of this and something Like vintage where people might not you know people can just get rid of an item of clothing they don't necessarily need but someone else will find a use for it particularly with kids clothing Like it is it is genius so there's a few interesting brands doing lots of things in different sectors but i think you know i could i could i can answer this question in a really long way with It because there's so many brilliant brands in the book that i love well ([Time 0:12:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/48577fdc-2e01-4fde-8111-62fe8c426334))
- **Consumer Spending Power**
  - Shifting even a small percentage of consumer spending towards change brands can have a significant impact.
  - This can create pressure on larger companies and influence legislation, leading to broader change.
  Transcript:
  Nick Hague
  Well, yeah, because I think, you know, our listeners might be sitting there thinking, you know, this all sounds good, but what can one individual, one person do that really have an impact? But they would be wrong in thinking that, wouldn't they? I mean, in your book, you talk about how us as individuals can make this impact by choosing how we spend our money. And that's the most important or most powerful lever that we have to tackle some of these world's biggest problems. Is it really that simple, do you think?
  Chris Baker
  Look, I think I'm not suggesting everything in the book is the perfect answer to all the world's ills, but I think it's a part of a theory of change, right? So when you look at the amount of money spent by consumers in every market, it's enormous. So it's between 60% and 70% of GDP. Consumer spend is 60% to 70% of GDP. So that's why whenever there's a recession, governments look to do things like eat out to help out or things to stimulate consumer spending because it gets the economy going. So if you look at that amount of money, I think in the UK, consumer spend is like 1.4 trillion. In the US, it's 14 trillion, I think. If you move 1% of that consumer spend globally every year, it's $700 billion. 1%, right? That's not beyond the realms of possibility. Actually, it's already happening in a lot of ways. I think Tony's Chocolonely are up to $200 million a year. Liquid Death are a £200 million brand. Oatly are into the billions you know big big companies that are getting lots of positive shift happening um fast growing brands like wild and small over here like it's you only need a Few percentage points and i think there's a bit in the book where it talks about if you can with movements if you can get 3.5 percent of the population doing something, it starts to be the Point where it reaches a tipping point, change happens, legislation comes in, and change starts to happen. The likes of Who Gives a Crap, Cheeky Panda, Serious Tissues, the direct-to sustainable toilet roll market is probably really close to 10%. So what you've seen is brands like Andrex and Cashel have introduced coreless rolls or double-length rolls to try and improve the sustainability of their product. Regina have launched a bamboo product, but it's only got 10% bamboo in it. We won't talk about that too much, but they're trying to make shifts because they're seeing this threat. So if you start to see three or 4% moving in that direction, then the bigger companies need to sit up and take notice because three, 4% of these categories is millions and millions and Millions of pounds and it affects bonuses and everything.

- **Encouraging Change**
  - Make positive change fun or aspirational to encourage behavior change.
  - Brands like Liquid Death and Patagonia achieve this through unique branding and associating their products with status.
  Transcript:
  Nick Hague
  The problem I sometimes see, Chris, is that we're all creatures of habit. And I've known about Ecosia for a while now, which is, if you've not heard of it, it's a search engine to rival Google, where every search and every advert you click on, they plant a tree. Therefore, each search is carbon negative. But I still default to Google. Are there any tricks that brands can use to make it easier to change behavior? I think there's a few.
  Chris Baker
  I mean, Ecosia have had a bit of a tipping point recently because you can now change. So I use Chrome, Google Chrome, but my browser is Ecosia because you can change it within the browser. Okay. All your bookmarks and all those things are saved. It still looks like Chrome, but it's using Ecosia. Right. That was quite a big thing. They had go through the european courts to to get that approved but that made it super simple um so no excuse not to do that yeah i'll definitely do that but um but i um i think there's lots Like i think one of the things that is really important about these brands is um making positive change feel like it's either fun or aspirational so you look we've talked about tony's Chocolate lonely it's a joyous positive brand that you want to be a part of not only is the chocolate great but everything about the brand is fun right so you're buying the brand because Of that i think if you know if unicef had tried to create a chocolate brand tackling child slavery it would probably have had sad looking pictures of kids holding machetes and, you know, Slightly blase about it, but it probably wouldn't have been Tony's. So that makes it fun. I think something like Liquid Death, an amazing canned water brand. I mean, it's basically water in cans rather than plastic bottles. They talk about murdering your thirst. Calling it Liquid Death is ridiculous, right? But it's very rock and roll very skate um started off at music festivals as a way of building distribution the the line death to plastic because it's cans not plastic bottles um the brand Is so fun like all their content is really punchy and interesting and kind of something that no one else would ever do so they make they make positive change really fun and aspirational And you want to be a part of that brand so I think that that's one thing that's really key um and I think the other thing is um is making something feel like it improves your status so people Buy brands because of what it says about them as individuals so you might buy Liquid Death because you're a bit rock and roll or whatever, right? You might buy Tony's because of the kind of fun that comes with it. But you also buy things because of status. So brands like Patagonia, firmly embedded as a status symbol. Every VC is cruising around in a Patagonia gilet um all birds trainers became a big staple in in vc circles for a while um and things like ocean bottle um the the water bottle it's a water Bottle that um recovers a thousand the equivalent of a thousand bottles of ocean bound plastic for everyone you buy um but it's a beautiful bottle, really amazingly high end, looks Like something like if Apple did water bottles, right? It's, they treat it in a way that it's a thing of beauty. So it feels like a high status thing, no matter what, right? And similarly, with like Fussy and Wild, again, they've created something that is, is a beautiful addition to your bathroom shelf. If you didn't care at all about plastic pollution it just still looks brilliant on your shelf so it's a it's a product for the influencer generation um i think as as steven bartlett might Have said on dragon's den um so yeah i think the you know fun aspirational positive also status, I think is one thing that I think when you're going out and when you're setting out to start A brand in these kinds of spaces, it's really easy to default to, you know, pulling on the heartstrings and getting serious and rational and, you know, almost brown craft paper and lots Of green if you're in sustainability. And I think you want to do the opposite because you end up in the health food aisle or you end up in the part of the supermarket that no one goes to. So you need to be competing with the big boys and wearing the clothes of a big aspirational brand. ([Time 0:35:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/5da6e212-ff57-4852-8050-45a4a78a2080))
- **Building a Change Brand**
  - Start by identifying a problem people care about, a problematic category, and a proven impact.
  - Break category conventions, aim for fame through disruptive marketing, and personalize the impact story.
  Transcript:
  Nick Hague
  Think is really, really interesting. Yeah, yeah, it really is. Okay, so we're going to imagine we've got this great idea, going into a third business for you, not the two, and we're looking to build a new change brand in a particular category. The six steps, key steps that you talk about, the reader through in the book, and we definitely don't have time, Chris, to do each one justice, but could you talk our listeners maybe through Some of those key things we need to consider if we're going to be successful in creating this brand?
  Chris Baker
  Yeah I think so I think the starting at the start so thinking about where that idea comes from I think I talk in one of the chapters about starting with impact and there's this model which I kind of talked about with with serious tissues where you go okay what's a problem that a lot of people care about what's a category that's got a problem so you think about serious tissues Loads of people care about climate change hugely front and center for everyone you know in every walk of life um category toilet roll is made of trees. And then you need a proven impact on that problem. So we are planting trees. So climate change, toilet roll made from trees, and a toilet roll business that plants trees. So if you can get those three things working together, and when you look at all these different categories, all these different brands in the book, you know, whether it's vintage, where There's a problem there's the category problem of waste and clothes going to landfill and the impact they have by creating this marketplace is huge right so i think that that kind of Framework is really useful to be able to figure out your proposition initially um and then i think there's probably two other big things when it comes to bringing the brand to market So one of the benefits of being a new entry is you can get every single bit of branding and marketing from every other competitor and get it on the wall in the room and you'll find there's A load of rules or a load of category conventions that everyone's doing so you think of the the water category everyone was in plastic clear bottles, they're talking about where the Point of origin of the product, they're talking about purity, it's very much about like, yoga mums and all this kind of stuff. And then liquid death way over here, and I've got like a black can that looks like a can of Rockstar with a massive skull on it, about death rather than life um murdering your thirst all The ads are greasy rock stars and there's one where you know there's an ad where they talk about um i'd rather lick um sweat off a fat guy's back than drink liquid death so they actually Made a taste test where someone has to lick sweat off a fat guy's back or drink liquid death and you know really funny right so pushing against those category conventions for a good reason I think with with tony's as well you know you think of every other chocolate bar it's all regimented very even in terms of how the chocolate is split tony's have changed the shape of their Chocolate so it's all in unequal shapes and sizes um because the inequality in the cocoa supply chain. Some of the shapes represent countries in Africa. Something talks about the open chain. There's a reason why they're throwing away those conventions, and it changes the experience, gives people something to talk about. Very, very cool. And then I think the other two bits around aiming for fame. You haven't got the budget of a massive, massive company where you can throw lots of money at TV advertising. So doing things that are disruptive and maybe a bit punchy. I know with Fussy, for instance, they've done loads of interesting stuff where they did something where they compared a Fussy product to a Unilever product. And Unilever sent them a cease and desist. They then delivered an olive tree to Unilever's headquarters in Blackfriars, filmed it, made some content from it. They got a reply from Alan Jope, the CEO at the time, on LinkedIn. So you can have some fun with stuff. Surreal, the protein cereal, really healthy protein-based cereal, created a billboard campaign where they found Dwayne Johnson's favorite cereal and Dwayne Johnson's a bus driver From Manchester. Serena Williams' favorite cereal, Ronaldo's favorite cereal. And obviously they're not the real Ronaldo's and Serena Williams but the fame they got from that the huge virality of that campaign really worked well so yeah I think starting with impact Thinking about how you can break the rules of a category and then thinking about how you can aim for fame um rather than kind of playing it safe I think would be the three big ones.
