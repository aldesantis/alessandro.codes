## Highlights

- Balancing Work Relationships and Remote Work
  Summary:
  The increasing trend of remote work due to the pandemic has highlighted the importance of work relationships and friendships.
  Studies show that having friends at work increases job satisfaction, but as more people work remotely, they struggle to connect with coworkers and maintain company culture. Remote work improves work-life balance for many, yet a significant portion find it challenging to build relationships with colleagues.
  This paradox reflects the ongoing transition in understanding how to effectively work remotely while still valuing interpersonal connections that were traditionally fostered in physical work settings.

  I did. Okay. No, I did dig some of this up. And it does really a lot back to the episode we did on loneliness a couple of weeks back. But for one, especially since the pandemic, you know, now that everybody’s working remotely or they have some sort of like hybrid set up with their work, that’s starting to complicate Things. There was a Gallup study that’s found even before the pandemic that there’s like an emphasis on work relationships and friendships, you know, we want to have a good friend at work. And there’s more emphasis on that. And it shows a greater impact on job satisfaction, having a friend at work. At the same time that’s happening, more of us are working remotely. And one of the biggest complaints that people cite about remote work is that they can’t connect with their coworkers as well. And just the larger company culture in general. And so you kind of touched on this with Cal Newport too. It’s kind of a, we want our cake and we want to eat it too. We want the flexibility of that remote work, but we also want good friends at work and those things, there’s a tension between those. This was a Pew research study. 71% of remote workers say that it improves their work life balance, but over half of them also say that they have trouble connecting with coworkers. So there’s this weird thing going on right now. I think we’re in this transition phase where we’re just trying to figure out how the hell we’re supposed to work remotely.
  Speaker 1
  I don’t know. What do you think’s going on there? It’s a sense to me. It’s the water cooler effect, right? Like when you, I haven’t seen any data on this, but I would imagine if you went back to say the 60s, 70s and 80s, I would imagine that most adult friendships originated either at work or Parents of other children that your children play with. Simply because those are the people that you’re going to see repeatedly over an extended period of time. ([Time 0:07:59](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9f531396-5f5a-446c-9a6b-30507e6553b6))
