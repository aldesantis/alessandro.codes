- Embrace YouTube’s Hidden Potential
  Summary:
  YouTube’s performance often appears underwhelming in traditional day-to-day analytics, leading many performance marketers to underestimate its effectiveness.
  This perception creates a significant competitive advantage, as numerous competitors dismiss the platform, leaving open space for those willing to explore it. Despite the complexity of marketing measurement and the challenges posed by misleading click-based attribution and double-counted conversions, the substantial incrementality demonstrated in YouTube campaigns presents a rich opportunity for savvy marketers.

  Speaker 2
  Yeah, that’s so interesting. I feel like that’s something I’m hearing a lot more about YouTube is that when they like actually Cody was saying this too when he runs YouTube and Tests it with house. He sees a really good incrementality factor behind it Yeah, but when you look at just the day-to analytics of the platform, you would think it’s not working at all.
  Speaker 1
  Yeah, I love YouTube. I think I’m one of YouTube’s best sales people, because I say performance marketers think it just can’t work, because they’re looking at click-based attribution. So there’s a ton of opportunity in terms of competition. Your competition is not there, because they think it doesn’t work. And so in terms of just auction dynamics and competitive pressure, there’s a lot of open space there for you.
  Speaker 3
  Marketing measurement is hard, and honestly, it’s just getting worse day by day. Reported conversions are often double counted across platforms and click-based attribution is misleading and oftentimes incomplete. ([Time 0:21:44](https://share.snipd.com/snip/07b11ec6-0b6c-417e-ab68-526ebbacafed))
