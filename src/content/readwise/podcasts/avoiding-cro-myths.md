## Highlights

- **Grocery Store Analogy**
  - Imagine your regular grocery store suddenly rearranging everything.
  - This analogy demonstrates how site redesigns frustrate returning customers, impacting conversions.

  Like let’s say you and I shop every single week in a specific grocery store. We have our itemized list. We are quite boring people. So we buy the same product every week. We know exactly where to go for our chicken, our cheese, our milk, our water, whatever it may be. We just, without even thinking, we just know where to go in that store. We know exactly where to go to go and check out. We know the clerk that we like at the checkout and we have a really good relationship with her and she gives us a bit of banter. We speak to her every single week. We know the exit. We skip out the exit because it’s so easy to find. And we don’t think twice about going back to that store every single week. And we never look at a competitor. All of a sudden, if you’re a big brand and you’re doing a lot of repeat purchases and you completely change things, this is like us going back to that grocery store the week after and I walk Into the entrance and where’s the door? Like it’s gone, it’s moved. Okay, I can’t get into the store. The first thing I have to do is try and find the entrance. Now I’m going to go buy my products around the store. And I honestly don’t know where they’ve gone. The chicken’s not in the same place. The milk’s not in the same place. The cheese is moo. I’m really like becoming frustrated now that I can’t just pick up these items that I do subconsciously and just pick them up. And then I finally find my items that have taken me twice as long. And I want to go to the checkout to pay for the items. And they’re in a completely different place in the store. And I become frustrated because I can’t find that checkout. How I get there, there’s some upsells in my way. If you’ve got to throw in different products in my way that weren’t there before. And then, you know, I finally get to the checkout. I can’t use the same payment method. The same clerk that I normally have the band with is less. She’s not there anymore. I finally paid for my item and I’m trying to get out of the store and the exit’s changed. And like the whole thing is a frustrating experience. And this is why nine times at 10, we see this time come again. When you do these things on your store, the repeat customers, you know, suffer, your conversion rates actually go up, down, and it takes a long way to kind of recover that side of things.

- **CRO Approaches Based on Site Traffic**
  - For established brands (100,000+ monthly sessions), prioritize iterative testing backed by data.
  - For smaller brands, focus on broader best practices and landing page optimization.

  Ask you as a brand, to me, no. It depends what your objective and goal is. Yeah, exactly. It depends what your outcome is. So yeah, I think that’s where you know above that hundred thousand sessions it’s qualitative and quantitative data it’s marrying the two yes it’s best practices but it’s having the Data to back up that assumption based on your demographic and and what your prospects and your audience does then it’s kind of a b testing and we use the phrase all the time like iterates To success it’s like we iterate via winning tests and we can update that design. We can update that brand on the variant that we’re testing, but it’s not a massive change. It’s not a big swing. It’s iterating to success and under the hundred thousand, pay those big sales.

- **CRO Diagnosis Process**
  - Implement post-purchase and exit-intent surveys to gather crucial customer feedback.
  - Use heatmaps and UX/UI walkthroughs, including personally purchasing your product, to identify friction points.
  Transcript:
  Kurt Elster
  We’ve touched it a little bit, but walk me through your typical process for diagnosing and improving conversion rates.
  Oliver Kenyon
  Yeah, absolutely. So on our ongoing CRO service, we spend probably tends toRO agency to effectively draw a picture of your demographic and create a roadmap of where we want to go to after. Those things are GA4 properly set up. Now, a lot of people have GA4, but a lot of people have problems with Google Analytics. So making sure that it’s correctly set up and tracking across the whole funnel so we can see where the bottlenecks are, where people are spouncing, where drop-offs are happening. And that’s like a non-negotiable yes. Non-negotiable number two is surveys. So two types of surveys, one post-purchase survey. So for those of your listeners who aren’t aware what that is, that’s simply a survey that sits on the confirmation step of your store. You purchase the product and then on that confirmation step, it says, hey, thank you so much for your purchase today. Would you just mind taking two minutes out of your day to answer a couple of questions so that we can make the experience better in the future for other customers and you and yourself? Now, what you want to ask in that post-purchase survey are a couple of really important questions. You can go product specific, but the broad questions you need to be asking are one, why did you purchase today? And two, what almost stopped you from purchasing today? That’s my favorite. The second question, yeah, there you go, right?
  Kurt Elster
  What almost stopped you? If you didn’t make a purchase today, what stopped you? If you almost didn’t purchase, why?
  Oliver Kenyon
  Because those are the objections. There you go. So as you rightly just said, that gives you so much data and commonalities between your audience. Because what you’ll find is like 100% of the audience, 70% of them will be saying the same thing. It will be like a common objection of like, let’s take a supplement product, for example. Oh, we just didn’t know how it takes to see results. Or we didn’t know what the daily dosage was. Or we didn’t know how many pills were included in a bottle or how long that lasted me. Is it a month’s supply? You’ll get all of these common objections that you can then take and utilize on the front end to handle that friction point, that objection, that want, that need of your typical demographic Of your customer. So we’ll always ask those questions post-purchase. We’ll also do exit intent surveys. Really interestingly, a lot of people utilize exit intent surveys for the wrong reasons. A lot of people think that they should use the exit intent surveys to get people back. That’s not what an exit intent survey is designed for the exit intent survey is designed to understand why someone exits so that you could handle that objection when that other person Who’s going to be a similar looking person within the demographic comes back so we were on a call a couple of weeks ago with a with a brand that’s doing around 150 million per year and they Said to me, they were like, oh, we couldn’t get exit intent surveys working. Like we tried to set them up, but none of the people were coming back. We were offering like coupons, discounts, et cetera. And we were like, because you’re using the wrong, you need to ask people why they’re leaving, because it’s not about capturing that person and bringing them back. It’s about capturing the reason why that person’s leaving. Because normally, you’ll find these commonalities again in those surveys of exits. So we’ll always set that up. So we’ve got GA4. We’ve got surveys. We tend to, as a non-negotiable, set up heatmap software. So whether that’s something like Karatee, which is free. We also like to use heatmap.com. Shout out to Dylan Nanda, a friend of mine, because heatmap.com will track based on revenue generated from clicks and not just clicks, which is really insightful. Can’t you do that in Clarity now too? You might be able to. You might be able to. That’s simply what we’ll use heatmap for, but they may have recently updated that for sure. Typically, what a heatmap software will do will tell you like where the velocity of clicks are happening but they won’t attribute a monetary amount to those clicks because what we’ve Seen especially using something like heatmap.com is like sometimes the the lesser clicked buttons are actually generating you more revenue so you can make more revenue informed Decisions based on clip. But we’ll also be looking into things like scroll maps, movements, etc. And then we’ll gather that data. So if you haven’t surveyed your audience, we’ll go out and send an email to your audience. The easiest way to do this, and you don’t have to use us to do this for any grants listing if you haven’t surveyed their audience, all you need to do is start with your VIP list. So segment in Shopify for repeat customers that are purchasing from you a lot. Segment them in Kladio, whatever EFP you use, and send out a broadcasted email that says, take two minutes to answer these questions and we’ll enter you into a draw for $100 Amazon gift Card. Now we’ve tried everything, by the way. We’ve tried discount. We’ve tried free products. We’ve tried Uber Eats, vouchers, et cetera. Amazon is the one that works the best. So just offer a free entry into an Amazon gift card, and then you can ask those questions. So don’t sit here listening to us going like, oh, whoever said I should have had post-purchase set there, but I missed all that data. You’ve still got that data in the form of an email. So just go and create a typefall or something to survey your customers. So we’ll always gather that data. We’ll gather the analytics, the heat maps, the tracking, et cetera. We’ll then do UX, UI walkthroughs. So we’ll actually go through your store, mobile, desktop, tablet, we’ll actually purchase your product, get to know the kind of whole feeling. And that’s another test that anyone could do, right? Like how many people are actually buying their own product on their own store? When’s the last time you actually went to your store and purchased your own product to see the experience? There might be a button that’s a bit misaligned. There might be something that’s confusing and that pisses you off within your funnel. Like imagine if it pisses you off what it does to your customers. So like definitely go and buy your own product. I think that’s a big tip um but we’ll that hold on that one sounds so basic and yet nobody does it it is right the number of things that we’ve uncovered by just making a purchase like i’ll
  Kurt Elster
  Just be like oh i you know a client sells something i need it i buy it and i’m like man i and i’m not blaming the merchant. In this example, I didn’t make a purchase either, right? But the moment you make that actual test purchase on a real device, suddenly you reveal the issues that may be on the site. But really, I think even better than doing it yourself, watch over the shoulder of someone who’s not done it before, and then you definitely uncover the issues.
  Oliver Kenyon
  Yeah, yeah, that’s a great, great method of doing it either in person or we do usability testing. So there are services where you can actually pay people to purchase products and they do screen recordings and give you feedback. So we’ll always do that as well. So we kind of marry…

- **Clarity Over Cleverness**
  - Avoid overly clever messaging; prioritize clarity and simplicity in headlines and copy.
  - Focus on clearly communicating the product’s value proposition and customer benefits.
  Transcript:
  Kurt Elster
  It’s really powerful. It’s just getting things done faster, better. And it sounds like that’s the approach you’re taking. One thing I want to know from you that I’m sure you have an opinion on. Tell me, give me one thing merchants should stop doing right now if they want better conversion rates.
  Oliver Kenyon
  I know there’s something that drives you nuts um yeah several things i mean again it’s it’s uh i have this strong thing around the kind of completely rebranding your site based on like A kind of a brand or a feel neglecting performance or neglecting you know necessities to actually convert people into customers um if you’re going to do that work with an agency who understands CRO and looks into the data and does it from a technical aspect, don’t just work with a brand agency. They’re just going to completely change your site for the kind of reasons I’ve already explained. I think that’s one kind of big mistake we see happen a lot. I think one thing that’s a common kind of occurrence between all brands, anyone who typically will own a product or an agency or software, or it doesn’t matter, we get very much too clever With our messaging. Because we eat, sleep, live, breathe our brand or our product or our agency or our SaaS or our membership, we, I guess, wrongfully assume that prospects know as much as we do about what It is we’re trying to sell. And therefore, we tend to try to be too clever. We talk about shiny objects and features and you know it kills me when i go to a website and people with that main headline are trying to be like really clever with the wording and there’s Like encrypted messages in there and like the the only way you can combat this is like to keep it simple stupid like i always say treat people like they’re five years old tell them exactly What you’re selling and the outcome that they’re going to get and that is like a mistake i see so many times that like people try to get really clever with the wording of their headline Or the way they try to sell things that they neglect actually telling their prospect what it is they’re selling and how that prospect is therefore going to benefit and the outcome they’re Going to get. So that’s a common occurrence that you kind of see quite a lot. Again, it’s that brand owner ego sneaking up in there, right?
  Kurt Elster
  Because the really clever copywriting, that’s fun. You’re like, wow, I am so smart. This is so clever for the 1% of the planet that’ll actually know what the heck I’m talking about. And they still won’t be confident, even if they know what you what you mean they’re like i’m not confident here and for that reason even though it’s not fun clarity being clear in your Messaging always trumps clever and i love clever it like it kills me to admit that but joe my gosh just be clear right that’s the hack 100%.
  Oliver Kenyon
  I think headlines and copy are so powerful. And, you know, use something like Henny Way app that just gives you a score rating based on like how simple your content is. And yeah, I think just right on that kind of like fifth grade, like it just needs to be so simple of like, this is what we’re selling and this is what you’re going to get out of it. You can then get clever further down the page and you can have the feature sections, but it’s like, it’s very cliche, but like, you know, features tell, benefits sell. And it’s all about like, what am I going to get out of purchasing this product? And I think so many times that gets neglected and people are like, they’re so proud of their product that they just forget the customer. And they just talk about like why they’re so proud of it and why it’s like got extra battery life and zoom and all these things that are irrelevant to the actual outcome you’re going to Get from purchasing it so um that’s a common mistake we see a lot as well definitely within like yeah neglecting i guess the prospect and the reason someone’s buying it and actually just Communicating that with them and just, you know, being lazy enough to expect that they’re going to know this with your clever copy and your features that you’re showing us.

- **CRO Myths Debunked**
  - CRO best practices exist and significantly impact conversions, especially above the fold.
  - Focus on revenue per session, not just conversion rates, for a more comprehensive performance measure.
  Transcript:
  Kurt Elster
  There a CRO myth that particularly frustrates you?
  Oliver Kenyon
  Yeah, I mean, I guess going back to that best practice, you know, scenario, I’ve spoken and listened to so many podcasts i’ve been in the industry for so long that like you know a lot of Cro agencies debunk that myth and say there isn’t best practices i agree with you there are there is a definitely a better way of doing it you know hiring the data with the kind of front End start but there is a thousand percent best practices there there are conversion principles that you should have in your landing pages and your pages especially particularly above The bulk that will a hundred percent make you convert better so I think um I think yeah like I say my big thing is like I’m probably the only CR agency that kind of says yeah there are best Practices and you should have them on your page regardless of what you’re doing. I think a lot of people like to say there isn’t because they want to, you know, so you want a long contract or, you know, they want to kind of do it that way. But that’s definitely not us. I think CRR best practices do exist. And I’m willing to die on that help. We’ve seen it time and time again, time and time again. I could audit, I would literally put my house on the fact that I could audit someone’s site, suggest best practices based on conversion principles. And if they implemented it, their conversion rates would go up. The other myth that I hate, Bank, is that the whole fact around conversion rate, the conversion rates matter. Conversion rates don’t matter. What matters are revenue per session or looking at your business as a whole. So anyone can increase conversion rates. We just reduce the price. We just slash our prices by 100% and your conversion rate is going to go through the roof. So start fixating on that conversion rate. What you really want to look at is conversion rate plus AAV. And that’s going to give you a revenue per visitor or, you know, how much you’re going to be making per visits to your site.
