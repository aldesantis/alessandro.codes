## Highlights

- **SaaS Priorities**
  - Venture-backed SaaS companies prioritize selling over serving, aiming for acquisitions.
  - Established e-commerce operators value reliability and responsiveness over flashy features.
  Transcript:
  Jason Lemkin
  The venture-backed ETC SaaS landscape has created a bit of a problematic ecosystem. See, the companies are building to sell rather than building to serve. And most founders are aiming for a Shopify acquisition, prioritizing flashy features over reliability. See, for the established ETC operators, people like myself, Mike, Sean, Jason, there’s so many of us, the priorities are very simple. It just needs to work. What matters is dependability, how companies respond to issues when they arise, their service levels. It’s how teams respond. It’s how, like, do they drop everything when there’s a customer issue? Do founders get their hands dirty? These things matter because this is the life that we live. Now, especially at large scale, you know, these kinds of brands, these large, big brands, they need software like Fulfill. They need things that are reliable, efficient, and things that support their growth and support them one-on And the funny thing is Shopify does this. You see this from Toby and Harley and their whole team. All they focus on is building and serving, and they’ve been doing it a long time. And look where it’s got them. See, a lot of Shopify apps, these DTC SaaS, I don’t know what to call them, the DTC SaaS ecosystem, they should take notice of this. I know Fulfill has. I spent a lot of time with that team. We like them for all of these reasons. There’s more than 50 of them now at that company. And I know that they’re very, very grateful for everyone who’s been listening to the show because they’ve had tons of people reach out to them for help.

Act as if you’re the guy in the room that has his stuff the most together. Act with confidence. It’s funny. I heard a story a guy told one time that was like the ultimate of this. He was at a conference and had a meeting in a room. He’s running a little bit late. He walks in the room. Table’s full. He goes and he gets the last remaining seat. He realizes five minutes into the meeting, he was like kind of mid-level, you know, guy at his corporation. He realizes this is literally just a meeting for CEOs that he is in completely the wrong room, like does not belong there at all. But you know what? Instead of getting up and leaving, he just acts like he belongs there. He asks a couple of questions. He engages. That’s amazing. It was like the ultimate act as if that nobody, they get so, we assume that people will know, they’ll be like, oh, you’re an imposter. You don’t belong here. You whatever. But it’s like, if you really just act the part so often, that’s half the battle. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I ([Time 0:03:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a6f5e5fa-b1dc-424e-8dc3-749e9d357433))

  Do you, are you guys, uh, Jason, I know you are, your fiscal is calendar lined Mike, is your fiscal calendar as well? Why, I got a question. Why do you wait so long in the year? Why do the planning at the very end of the year? Why not? We’re like Jason. We did our 2025 planning, I want to say, a week and a bit ago. We get it all done. Then from now until annual kickoff in January, but the same time as you, you know, we have time to like collect our thoughts and all that stuff. What’s, what’s the.

- **HexClad’s Budgeting**
  - HexClad grew rapidly and struggled with budgeting due to unpredictable growth.
  - They now use a top-down and bottom-up approach, focusing on country and channel leaders.
  Transcript:
  Jason Lemkin
  Who’s involved? If you’re going to go through the budgeting process, who’s doing that in your companies at this scale? I’d be actually curious, Jason. So like you guys had everybody in for two weeks, building out forecasts for next year. What does that look like? Like you’re very in the weeds on that on numbers. Uh, you know, how is it like a top down? Like, Hey guys, this is the goal or is it bottoms up? This is what we can, this is the data.
  Sean Ellis
  Yeah. You know, it’s, it’s actually very, it’s interesting, you know, and you have to tackle it from both directions, top down and bottom up. And we’ve gotten so big now. We actually hired over 80 new people in 2024 at HexCloud.
  Mike Michalowicz
  How big is your total team, Jason?
  Sean Ellis
  It’s about 200.
  Mike Michalowicz
  Is that including Roadshow?
  Sean Ellis
  Yes.
  Jason Lemkin
  That’s actually really impressive. What’s your HQ team? Sorry, HQ being like…
  Sean Ellis
  HQ, in office, employees are in the 45-ish neighborhood. And then we have probably 30, 35 hybrids, little remote people because they just don’t happen to be. We have a little office in Denver for the growth team. And yeah, so we’ve added a ton of people this year. And our business, like many of the businesses that listen to this pod is very Q4 heavy. And so, and, and add on top of that, that we, we’ve just been this rocket ship for years and years now, like this is the first year that we, A, we at least have, like we can start actually predicting Growth, right? It’s like, because we, you know, we were got so big, you know, last year that this year it’s like there’s no way we were going to double this year like the math just doesn’t work laws of physics Cannot yeah you have laws of big numbers they catch you yeah yeah so we still grew really really nicely but it’s a release now able to like okay we don’t have to be in a position where we don’t Know if we’re going to double or grow 70% or grow 150%. Like, and it’s kind of a shame that we don’t have that anymore, obviously, but that’s just life and business. And so, um, all that, all that said, like, we were never, we were hardly able to budget in the past. It was like, it was like a, it almost didn’t matter because we were growing so fast and the numbers were just going to be wrong. And fortunately for us, profitability was never an issue. Cash flow can be an issue and there have been times because we’re just buying so much inventory, got to pay taxes. We talked about all that stuff. This year, with the combination of more reasonable growth and maturity of our business and financing. We cleaned up a lot of things this year. And so we started back in September working on next year budgets, but still it like, because so much of our business is in November and December, it’s, you know, how do you, how do you, When do you start? So we had like a slow roll. And then in the last month, we’ve been going hard. And to your point about, you know, how do you forecast? I’m looking at last year’s growth rate. And then I’m saying, okay, what is a growth rate that is acceptable to us as a management team? And what do we have to do at a country by country and channel by channel level to hit those numbers? I just like, to me, there’s really no better way. And so we’ll go out to every country leader and every channel leader and be like, okay, what do you think you could do? And then we put that into our overall growth target for the year sort of like triangulate and work with these teams. You know, one team might have more aggressive goals in their mind than we need them to have. Another team might have less aggressive goals and they need to step it up and not be wimps. And like, that’s so that’s sort of that’s sort of how we do it. And then the biggest expenses for us, you know, cogs are cogs. Like those are pretty good. Like we know what those are going to be because we’ve been working with this situation for a while. So there’s cogs and then there’s fulfillment costs, which is a big number for us. And we recently totally rebooted our entire fulfillment network a new huge new 3pl um and that was a our team’s like yeah we’ll do that in september right before q4 like yeah great idea Guys what could go wrong yeah yeah yeah yeah there’s no list there jason you’re totally fine i know they they actually they actually pulled it off because i basically said you know you, You’re betting your job here, right? I mean, I was joking, but they pulled it off. It came out great. Our ops team, you know, our COO, Niles, our ops team, Brian, like they just absolutely crushed it. And so but fulfillment and fulfillment costs are really interesting because like we had our own warehouse for a long time and we still do. But the minute you max out that warehouse, all of a sudden your margins drop because it’s sort of like there’s operating leverage in filling up that warehouse. And essentially the marginal cost until the warehouse is full, the marginal cost of the next order is nothing, right? Until you fill up the warehouse and you’re like, shoot, I need to go get new space. I need to get more people. I need to run all this, right? And so we went through that this year. And our fulfillment costs went up this year as a function of our incredible growth over the last two years. So now with the new 3PL and all the planning that we’ve done, we’re going to see those margins improve, which is great. And then the third bit is marketing. And, you know, that’s I think marketing expense is the hardest to and we use like we’re heavy users of North Beam. We’re heavy users of MMM. We’re doing a lot of other things with data analytics and data warehouse and data science to try to figure this stuff out. But like I continue to think that we spend too much on meta. But I’m still yet I’ve still yet to win that fight with everyone. So those are the levers. That’s where, you know, all there, right? We’ve got content costs. We’ve got certain brand awareness stuff that we do. But those are really kind of down in the noise. You got to get those big two, the fulfillment costs and the marketing expenses done right to support the growth levels that you’re trying to get to.

- **Growth and Planning**
  - Meaningful growth at scale requires deterministic planning and large bets.
  - Translate growth goals into specific buying and planning goals for realistic execution.
  Transcript:
  Mike Michalowicz
  Well, one of the things that I’ve really, we’ve been wrestling with a lot with our team, Jason, I’m sure this is true of you, Matt, same with you is that once you get to a certain scale, you Realize to meaningfully move the business means something has to generate, you know, basically tens of millions of dollars. Yes. And that cannot happen without a tremendous amount of deterministic planning. So put it another way, like, well, if we think a product line, you know, can produce 10 million, 15 million dollars in growth, you got to buy for that. You’re going to have to buy whatever, five million dollars more of inventory or something. And so it really does start to become what are the places in my business that can drive growth where I’m willing to make very big bets from my capital structure and from my planning side To be able to set myself up to have the possibility of putting up this growth? Because at our scale, you really can’t say, oh, this thing’s going really well in May and translate it into fiscal results for this year, right? It’s just, it doesn’t work that way. The numbers are too big. You have to kind of be able to stand over your business and do it more deterministically and do it further out. This is one of the things that I’ve said about new product launches that no new product launch has the ability to be meaningful to our business in year one, which has been good to know that Because I think it’s helping us to break some of our bad habits. But anyway, the bottoms up approach, what it does is it kind of nests with planning, I think a lot more naturally because ultimately whatever your growth goal is, has to lead to planning And buying goals because otherwise your growth goals are completely unrealistic.

- **Inventory Management**
  - Running an inventory-based company involves managing overstock and understock.
  - Decide where you are willing to sacrifice: share, turns, or margins.
  Transcript:
  Mike Michalowicz
  You know, it’s going to be wrong. I mean, basically running an inventory based company is the adventure of half of your job is managing the places where you’re wrong and you have too much. And the other half is managing the parts where you’re wrong and you have too little. It’s like, and, and so that’s, that’s just kind of comes with the, the territory. But one of the thoughts that I think we’ve realized as we’re continuing to grow and dealing with these problems of scale, And I think you’re, you’re probably dealing with this also, Jason, some of your forecasting, I’d be curious how you’re approaching this is you, you start asking questions of, okay, when we’re wrong and we’re going to be wrong, where are we willing To sacrifice? And usually it’s, are you willing to sacrifice on share? Are you willing to sacrifice on your turns? Are you willing to sacrifice on your margins? And so I’d be curious, like this is one that really comes back to, I think, how your ownership structure of your organization looks, what the goals of your organization are. So I’ll give a really practical example. And I would say our business has, let’s call it four main verticals that we sell right now. Three of the four, we’re crushing it. And one, I think we’re getting beat. We’re kind of bleeding. So one of my big strategic things for this next year is it’s like we are going to turn around this area where we’re getting beat, because if we can turn that around, it’s actually pretty Easy to get to a good growth number. But if we keep losing share here, like it’s going to be a massive problem. It can sink the ship. And so the kind of the question that my team has kind of put before me is like, okay, how important is share to you here? How does that tie in with our desire on capital efficiency with turns? And how does that tie in with margins? And in our particular case, I’m like, share is even more important than margins to me in this particular category, because for the first time ever, we’ve lost share in that category. And I don’t think that can continue. But I’m also not, you know, considering selling the company, considering going public, anything like that. So I don’t have to particularly worry about the margins piece. Really the person that it impacts me as a shareholder financially, but it doesn’t really impact anything about the external of the company. Jason, with you guys, how do you think about the balance between those things as you’re setting out to do your planning for next year? That’s a great question. The balance of what? Margin? Margin, share, and inventory turns. What are you prioritizing? When you’re wrong, like you said, when you’re wrong on a SKU or a product line, you basically end up either having to say, I’m just willing to hold it longer and be heavy for a while, or I’m Willing to get aggressive on price to, to move it and keep my turns good and to get my share growing.

- **Market Data Sources**
  - Mike’s company now uses data from Sercana and other tools to understand market share.
  - They combine actuals from retailers with survey data for a comprehensive view.
  Transcript:
  Jason Lemkin
  I, I want to poke a little bit on this share thing. Cause it’s, this is a really cool topic. We’ve not gone after this yet on the pod mike your how okay so i like i got a bunch of questions like where do you get your data for category share so like what share of the category in each Of these categories that you’re in and then you know maybe after that jason like i would love to hear how you think about cookware and Hexclad’s, the growth of the category is one element. And how much of that growth and how much of the existing share are you actually capturing? So Mike, where do you go for this data? So if somebody’s listening to this, you want to know.
  Mike Michalowicz
  Pretty great. So practically, I think building out the ability to understand what’s going in the larger market is something that’s happened in the last 24 months with us. For a long time, we just basically looked at our numbers and we’re, you know, I don’t want to say we were unconcerned, but we didn’t really care what was going on with the larger market Because we weren’t big enough that we were completely captive to it. As you get bigger and bigger, your performance is in large part dictated by the headwinds or tailwinds that your category is experiencing and what is happening with other people. So the larger you get, the more you have to build out this competency. There are three or four main places that we go to grab data. There with Amazon, there are some ways you can kind of scrape your way. There’s some different SaaS tools to kind of estimate sales rates. But there’s an organization that we use where we go and we buy aggregated data. They do it two different ways. One is they have a tool where the retailers will actually provide their data. And so you’re getting actuals. And then they have another tool, which is kind of cool, where it’s basically a surveying system where they do receipt surveying across a really large sample, and then they extrapolate That data. So that data is not actuals. And sometimes it can be a little bit less accurate, but directionally, it gives you a really good idea of what’s happening. I think Sercana is the name of the organization that we use, or that was its name at one point. Maybe it’s something else now. And so we’ll look at the Sercana data, and it will give you a very good picture of what’s going on in certain channels. Places where it’s not great, DTC numbers don’t get reported by most people to Serkana. Yeti reports their DTC numbers to Serkana, or maybe it’s because they’re public that Serkana has them. So that’s really interesting. It’s actually interesting, something crazy. It’s like if you considered Yeti’s website a channel, just like Costco or Walmart, it would be like the fifth biggest retailer in drinkware or something, or it’s, it’s pretty crazy. But so you can kind of get a feel of what’s going on across all these major channels with your competitors and how that’s, that shifting. And then I think there’s some really good DTC tools out there. Uh, many, you know, common thread has a tool that, uh, you can look at. There’s, there’s quite a few different thing, different scraper services out there that, that will give you estimates.

- **Market Awareness**
  - Start by focusing on your own numbers and less on the market.
  - As you grow, track category performance, headwinds, tailwinds, and competitor actions.

  Pretty great. So practically, I think building out the ability to understand what’s going in the larger market is something that’s happened in the last 24 months with us.

- **Market Share Dynamics**
  - Market share data helps contextualize growth and reveal vulnerabilities.
  - Gaining share creates a positive feedback loop with retailers, while losing share does the opposite.
  Transcript:
  Sean Ellis
  Yeah. Particle gets a lot of airplay that we’ve, my team uses their product. I think, um, there’s a couple others out there like that as well.
  Mike Michalowicz
  So you’re trying to kind of aggregate a lot of the different sales data. And ideally, you have multiple sources that kind of serve as check and balances on each other if one of them throws out a really screwy number. And you also start to get a real feel for the market. So sometimes you’ll hear numbers where you’re like, I don’t think that’s true. That doesn’t fit in the overall concept of like what’s going on in the market. But we’ve, we’ve gone from, I would say pretty ignorant. Like I’ll give a really good example of this. Nobody knows what Stanley did in 2023 in revenue. Well, no, they don’t. It’s a huge breakout story. And then somebody somewhere said they did 750 million in revenue. And so everybody just kind of ran with that. And I don’t know what the revenue is, but I’ll tell you this, based on the numbers I’m looking at and the different things I can see, I would be really surprised if Stanley didn’t sell as Much drinkware as Yeti did over a 12 month period. And Yeti selling 30 something million units and you start to do some math and you’re like, I think they probably sold a lot closer to a billion or a billion, you know, 1.25 billion. That 750 number was just kind of, somebody said it somewhere and everybody ran with it. But you, you, you start to get an idea of kind of like what’s happening. Then I think, so that’s share of like actual market. You also start to get a feel for what is my market doing? So in our case, um, you might feel really good. Like this year, I think we grew maybe 15% as a company. I don’t know. I’d have to look at the numbers, but, and, and coming off a hundred percent growth year, we felt pretty good about that. We felt like this was a consolidation year, but our category might’ve grown 17%. I don’t know. We don’t know the final number. And so it contextualizes your growth. If you grew 15%, but your category grew 17%, then you actually shrunk in relative in share, you shrunk. And so you shouldn’t feel awesome necessarily about that 15%. Whereas if your category put up a negative five and you grew 15%, you should feel, I think, great about what’s going on. So it contextualizes your numbers in a way that’s helpful. It also helps you to understand, especially if you’re selling into mass retailers, it helps you to understand where are you vulnerable? What are the retailers likely thinking going into things? So there is a little bit of a self-perpetuating dynamic that can happen with market share that goes a little bit like this. You’re gaining share and retailers are looking at reports that say you’re gaining share and they want to show their boss that they’re expanding with brands that are winning. So they give you more spaces on the shelf, which leads to you gaining even more share, which leads to you having momentum that leads to even more share. And so you can get in this positive feedback loop. And then the opposite, that is also true. Once you become a brand that’s quote unquote losing share, then all of a sudden there’s a lot of justification for buyers to give you less spaces on the shelf or to lean into you less, which Leads to even less sell through, which leads to even less share. And it can create a negative feedback loop. So these are things that we’ve gotten a lot more concerned with. And then I think the other side of it is you start thinking about things like share a voice. And there’s a lot of tools out there where you can start to say, hey, relative to other people, what’s it looking like with Google searches? What’s it looking like with Amazon searches? What’s it looking like with social media mentions? And we’ve gotten quite a bit more analytical about that as well. And all of this matters because then you can hopefully tie those numbers to what you’re doing. When we do X, this is the response and share of voice. This is the response and share of market. We want to do more of this. We want to do less of this, that kind of stuff. All ([Time 0:35:19](https://share.snipd.com/snip/cb2aca27-c703-4718-8f75-f10b16fada0e))

- **Data-Driven Decisions**
  - Focus on the 1% of data that drives actionable insights, not vanity metrics.
  - Use data to sanity-check planning and assess market share realism.
  Transcript:
  Mike Michalowicz
  Want to say a couple of things about it. Cause you know, Jason, you were like, I don’t believe in it. I think there’s two things that are really important. The analyst in me is going to stand up and say two really important things. Number one, there’s so much data. There’s almost limitless data out there. And 99% of it, you can’t really use it to make actionable insights and decisions in your business. Wisdom is knowing what the one person is that can actually change how you think and change how you make decisions. Most people don’t have that skill. Their dashboards are a bunch of navel gazing vanity things that they like to refresh and watch the numbers change. But wisdom and smart business owners are able to kind of find the signal in the midst of all the noise and say, if I focus on this one thing, it helps me understand how to make better decisions. Smart people know how to find that 1%. Are you one of the people that knows how to do that? So you’re wanting to build your business in that way. And it also helps you to understand taking this all the way back to planning. If you’re expecting, like I’ll give a really practical example. There have been a couple times that we set growth goals based on, we looked backwards and we said, well, we grew whatever, 75% last year. We think we can grow 50% this year, but we weren’t paying attention to how big we had gotten as share of market in that particular channel. And it was never realistic to hit the number that we were trying to hit. Once you considered, so like, I’ll just give an example. We were growing like crazy in kids’ backpacks on Amazon. But what we didn’t do one year during our forward-looking planning is say, what percentage of kids’ backpacks, under seven-year kids’ backpacks, do we already represent on Amazon? Instead, we just kind of threw out our goal of what we thought we could do the next year. But if you had taken that number and relativized it to the amount of kids’ backpacks that Amazon was selling, you would have really quickly said, that’s probably not a very good goal Because that means you’re going to be at like 50% share or something, you know, at a really premium price point, like a number that’s just not realistic. And so I think that it can be helpful in terms of sanity, checking your planning of, is your planning realistic? Is it rooted in reality ([Time 0:45:43](https://share.snipd.com/snip/27641d17-1ee8-4cdd-89fa-436791d8608c))
