And we had all our friends over. And we it was that time of the night where like the Ubers were getting called. We're going to take a shot. You know, it's like the last free alcohol before the night. So we're rounding up the troops, getting everyone to take a shot. And we're looking for a chaser. And all we had was like some ginger ale some old ginger ale like some stale limes and like maybe some cranberry juice so you know everyone's just like dreading it like oh there's nothing That's gonna really cover the taste but you just have to do it so you know we just looked at each other we're just like there has to be something better so we made it and that is how we started Chaser.
