## Highlights

- Episode AI notes
  1. E-commerce growth is limited by the value of existing customers, leading to slower compounding for many businesses.
  2. The default growth rate of a business often aligns with customer lifetime value (LTV), typically resulting in 20 to 50% growth.
  3. Companies that significantly enhance customer value, such as through subscription models, can achieve higher growth rates.
  4. Efficient customer acquisition is crucial for surpassing velocity constraints in growth.
  5. Businesses that excel in marketing can overcome limitations associated with lower customer value compounding. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/episode-takeaways/9cac660f-e7d4-4059-84b1-96a88535a6bd))
- Growth Rate is Limited by Customer Value
  Summary:
  The velocity constraint dictates that a business’s default growth rate aligns with the revenue compounding from its current customers.
  In many cases, businesses compound customer value slowly, resulting in a growth rate of 20 to 50% based on one-year lifetime value (LTV). However, companies that significantly increase customer value, like certain subscription models, can achieve much higher growth rates.
  This highlights the importance of efficiently acquiring new customers; businesses that excel in marketing can surpass their velocity constraints despite having lower customer value compounding.

  Speaker 1
  And there’s this rule that I call the velocity constraint, which is that the default growth rating for your business is comparable to the rate at which you compound revenue from the Customers that you have. So all of you guys, I’ve always been sort of a fascination to me because none of you compound the value of your existing customers very quickly. Like your LTVs in your product categories are not very good. So your velocity constraint like the default growth rate for all of your businesses should probably be somewhere in the 20 to 50% range because I’m guessing that’s where your one-year LTV comes in. But if you are a business where you compound the value of your customer 300% in a year, you guys had Tureen on here, Bobby’s an example of that, where you just have these subscription businesses With their default growth rate should be much higher. Now, but that’s why I think it’s been so fascinating about what you guys have all done from a marketing standpoint is that you’ve been able to consistently acquire new customers so efficiently And quickly that you’ve been able to exceed your default velocity constraint. But that’s an important point for people. ([Time 0:41:18](https://share.snipd.com/snip/20f78fd4-262f-46e3-9c06-112877e0aad8))
