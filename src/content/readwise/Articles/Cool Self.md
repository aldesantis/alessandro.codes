## Highlights
- *Life is about finding your cool self and then living as much of it as you can being that person*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58c0bb38s3e8znka9n6bppw))
- cool means being *authentic, confident, calm, and original*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58c169e2zs7mwz28vyh3v0h))
- Cool is also something *you feel about yourself*. There are times I feel cool, and there are times I definitely do not. Cool is as much a matter of self-identity as it is of projection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58c248t6azv0zdm94kmngv2))
- Inner cool is closer to self-worth and self-actualization; outer cool is a never-ending game of belonging and status. Ideally, you want to focus on cultivating the inner cool, make it spill over into the outer cool, and live in that state of being as much as you can. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58c2j62w6986r070mjzchrc))
- Loving someone is arguably thinking they are one of the coolest people you know, if not *the coolest,* just for being *themself*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j58c7408svbtcw0ytwkfxhz1))
