## Highlights
- Maybe it’s not that we have less monoculture today; it’s that we’re more aware of everything else in the other quadrants of the chart. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8sk4kd4qtb9699v2tn5zaca))
- But today, American shoppers hold a strained relationship with big business, influenced by sentiments around wealth disparity and corporate abuse (From Occupy to Big Tech and Big Pharma). In the presidential race, both candidates use small business as a talking point to win the sympathy of voters. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8sk915bpgcjyr4pjhxaeza8))

- For every Nike misstep over the generations, Phil Knight’s atoned by infusing the product with value – namely, ramping up quality and innovation. But what happens when consumer psychology shifts? What does Nike do if the shopper perceives value as prestige or profitability instead of performance? The game becomes less about technical design and superior construction and more about scarcity and clout. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j8skp1rdtqvty4v2eff7ka4z))
