## Highlights
- Supply chains that depend on small, family-run businesses sound romantic, but experts say it is the biggest threat to Made in Italy’s survival. Fragmentation makes it harder for brands to gain visibility over their supply chains, which is a problem in the [age of traceability regulation](https://www.voguebusiness.com/story/sustainability/the-fashion-execs-guide-to-digital-product-passports), explains Andrea Sianesi, professor of operations and supply chain management at Italian university Politecnico di Milano, who is part of an expert task force assembled by the prefecture of Milan to clean up Italy’s supply chains in light of recent probes.

- Fragmentation also creates an imbalance of power, which allows poor practices to fester, and increases the likelihood of subcontracting, he continues. “When there is a negotiation over reducing costs, the brands are very strong and the suppliers are very weak. In this environment, bad behaviour can happen, because suppliers might cut costs by overlooking the legal frameworks regarding the health, safety, security and salaries of workers. Small does not equal bad behaviour, but it’s much easier to audit one big company than 10,000 smaller ones.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb1qddf018a7232tjany716w))
