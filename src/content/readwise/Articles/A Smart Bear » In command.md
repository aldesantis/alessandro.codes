## Highlights
- Being “in command” doesn’t mean you’re constantly telling people what to do. It means you’re acting as an editor, not a writer, unless being a writer is necessary to make progress. And if *that* is happening constantly, that you make a change on the team so that it’s *not* happening constantly. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h83ysprh9kczg5nxnmth8rf9))
