## Highlights

- Brands who offer D2C miss out on the power of multi-purchase or ‘complementary’ shopping, and the value provided by expert merchandising. This enables additional sales to be captured by grouping dissimilar items and different brands that are frequently purchased together, because of the customer intention.
