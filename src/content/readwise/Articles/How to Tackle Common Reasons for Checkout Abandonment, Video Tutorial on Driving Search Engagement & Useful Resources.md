## Highlights
- • Offer a [price match promise](https://ao.com/help-and-advice/finance-and-savings/price-match-promise/) if you sell branded goods that can be bought from other retailers; [AO.com](http://AO.com) does this well, asking customers to call them and they even offer to refund the differences if the price drops for a product already ordered
  • Emphasise genuine USPs and the benefits of shopping directly with you e.g. as the brand owner, it could be an extended warranty, or access to exclusive content and events
  • If you have a genuine sustainability commitment that means you won't always be the lowest price, explain the benefits of buying with you.
