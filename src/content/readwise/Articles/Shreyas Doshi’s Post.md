Many people in top positions often follow trends rather than making thoughtful decisions, influenced by mimetic desire and conformity bias. By consciously evaluating these factors, you can diverge from the crowd, leading to fulfilling work and a deeper connection to your career. Making deliberate choices will ultimately lead to better outcomes and increased confidence in your career decisions.
