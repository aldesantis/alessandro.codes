## Highlights
- Trends aren’t meant to have a 365-day shelf life. It takes time for change to gestate. Also, the topics forecasted in 2018 (ex. new family structures, fondness for the physical, and mainstreaming psychedelics) are still budding today, and therefore still legitimate to report on. Expecting new movements and norms to track at the same pace as our memes and headlines is unrealistic. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvgh8t1d8t31e891qhdtdpmx))
- Even if we are unfairly impatient, organizations which are proclaiming to be able to identify and analyze change are, semantically, just discussing the past. *Fantastic*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvghctt5gs8bzhpjagb031hp))
- By considering yourself as an observer of culture, you neglect your responsibility as a critical contributor. Accept that you too are a part of the system. Get off the sidelines. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvghkwt606qq3fx3veptbfa0))
- AI augmentation is a future requirement, but remain mindful of what’s outsourced. Going forward, we need more demanding journeys than we do mindless shortcuts. Shortcuts rarely yield fun, stories or lessons. If it's easy, it likely isn’t worthwhile. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvghmkhnn6xzvymmgkccfdrq))
- Trend reports play it safe pumping existing hype with business on the line. But foresight isn’t about prediction, and it’s more than preparation. *It’s choice*. Instead of predicting and being wrong, more valuable: imagine what you *want to see*. You can’t be wrong in that. After all, a good futurist provokes and admits that they don’t have the answer. Manifest. Possibility > Probability. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvghngvzd2xv1v2are43d6yq))

- Only two out of 50 trend reports acknowledge their previous work. We have to reflect if we’re to grow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvghpppmn7v43akdjkkhcncd))
- Soon, proof of humanity will be a zag. Zagging breaks us out of the recursion loop of reporting on what’s already trending, comments about comments, franchises about franchises, and AI speaking to AI. We’ve begun to deprive ourselves of the novel, idiosyncratic and interesting. Zag. *Please*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvghqj6cfejmnvm609e8anj0))
- **Imagine:** More audacious demands and shaming of people, not brands ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvgj25rq2rasztwaz0zgx3bq))
- **Imagine:** (Even more) eye contact practice videos and cuddle therapy 
  **What if:** By emulating machines, we atrophy our best qualities? 
  **To Play:** Celebrate the ambiguous, artistic, vulnerable, and unknown ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvgj666d8dbrz47wf0jx715w))
- **Imagine if:** Algos become our cigs — customized = unhealthy 
  **What if:** We could never return to a one-size-fit-all way of life? 
  **To Play:** Offer minimal viable resonance w/o segmenting infinitely ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hvgj92qg8myqzdeeyzk5427g))
