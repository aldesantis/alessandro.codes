## Highlights
- When I wrote about the virtues of empowered product teams, I was referring to what I’ll continue to call here as product teams.  Specifically, they are cross-functional (product, design and engineering); they are focused on and measured by outcomes (rather than output); and they are empowered to figure out the best way to solve the problems they’ve been asked to solve.

- Recall that in product there are always four risks:
  Value risk (will people buy it, or choose to use it?)
  Usability risk (can users figure out how to use it?)
  Feasibility risk (can we build it with the time, skills, and technology we have?)
  Business Viability risk (will this solution work for the various dimensions of our business?)
    - Tags: [[product-management]] 
- In an empowered product team, the product manager is explicitly responsible for ensuring value and viability; the designer is responsible for ensuring usability; and the tech lead is responsible for ensuring feasibility.  The team does this by truly collaborating in an intense, give and take, in order to discover a solution that work for all of us.

- in a feature team, you still (hopefully) have a designer to ensure usability, and you have engineers to ensure feasibility, but, and this is critical to understand: the value and business viability are the responsibility of the stakeholder or executive that requested the feature on the roadmap.
