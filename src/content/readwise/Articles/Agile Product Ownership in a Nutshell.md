## Highlights
- Our goal is not to produce as much output as possible. Our goal is reach the desired outcome, using the least possible output.
- Knowledge is the opposite of risk. So when uncertainty is high, our focus is knowledge acquisition- we focus on things like user interface prototypes and technical spikes, or experiments. Not too exciting for the customers, but still valuable because we are reducing risk.
    - Note: Knowledge acquisition reduces/eliminates risk.
- Itâ€™s generally better to reduce scope than to extend time, because if reduce scope first, we still have the option to extend the time later and add the rest of the stories.
