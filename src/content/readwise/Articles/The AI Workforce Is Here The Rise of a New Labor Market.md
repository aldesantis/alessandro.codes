summary: |
  The rise of AI workers is merging the software and labor markets, creating new opportunities for founders and reshaping the way work is done. AI services replacing human-centric services will lead to more demand for AI workers in the future, offering job opportunities and the chance for rapid workforce re-skilling. Companies are developing AI colleagues and AI vendors/services to deliver human-quality labor with software margins, revolutionizing industries and increasing efficiencies.

## Highlights
- Now, software can both organize and execute tasks. Labor and software are fusing into one massive market. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1s9avmw8s85tqyx8es6pkbk))
- In this labor transition, we expect the historical margin gap between service businesses (below 30%) and SaaS businesses ([above 80](https://news.crunchbase.com/saas/improving-gross-profit-margin-bhasin-allied/#:~:text=High%2Dquality%20SaaS%20businesses%20have,be%20a%20cause%20for%20concern.)%) to shrink as AI services replace human-centric services enabled by SaaS tools. Service margins will become software margins. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j1s9b62ddv9yw9r6zhx6k3ts))
- We do expect some roles to disappear as this fusion accelerates. But AI is likely to create a form of Jevons paradox in the long run – where increased efficiency leads to a short term reduction in a resource, but a long-term surge in demand that creates more resource use.
