## Highlights
- Cultural companies design products from the core of the community they want to serve, *and* are open to expanding their brand story into something more akin to a lifestyle vs. a one-off product. Bringing your co-creators upstream with you, and knowing exactly what you’re designing for is a way to guarantee adoption and amplification. Identifying a muse target audience and inviting them into the creation process with you has no downside. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0axaxy7nd44cn5fnwxhn5fq))
    - Tags: [[Marketing]] [[culture]] [[branding]] 
- Brands do not need to take on a role of ‘building’ community if they can act in the more credible role of ‘facilitating’ it (hat tip [Marcus Collins](https://www.instagram.com/p/C8DDlm4PjId/)). Giving a defined and engaged audience the simplest set of tools or an experience, and letting them do what they do, is better than briefing a creator within an inch of their life on the most prescriptive, product-marketing heavy ask you’ve ever seen. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0axb9kfdjx15h4tzkgb8nqj))
- The simpler and more easy your brand codes are to emulate, the more participation and expression you can inspire. Embrace a lo-fi, hands-on system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0axbgypqsxaqzn2dydp0yf1))
