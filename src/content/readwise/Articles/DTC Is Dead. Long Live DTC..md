## Highlights
- No one eliminates the middle person, they simply become the middle person, and that brings its own set of costs. So for a period of time, people became so obsessed with where they sell rather than what they sell that they lost track of who they were.

- Wholesale, if done correctly, allows brands like us to connect authentically with the local customer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcde2bvwae17cntqrafek4re))
- One of our masters is the consumer, but the other master is the brands. Because the brands don’t have to be in our store necessarily and what we’ve got to prove to them is that we’re a worthwhile partner. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcde6bjsw999gbst8tqvvw9m))
- “I think we’ve moved from retailers having the advantage. The retail-brand wholesale relationship used to be heavy, heavy retail. That was your point of distribution and the retailer chose which brands were most important, right?” Katz said.

- “You will get businesses that start off in both ways, but I think what is fortunate is … we’ve moved on from simply condemning a channel,” Siegel said. “There’s no such thing as a bad channel. There are bad partnerships and there’s bad execution.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcdearvd2b81213tenzehhky))
- Another challenge for new brands, according to Saunders, is the simple fact that “there’s a lot of stuff out there” already. Any startups in retail now have to make it through a noisy landscape and offer a valuable enough proposition to gain shopper interest. Identifying as a “DTC brand” just doesn’t much matter anymore.

- You should not aspire to be a DTC brand. You should aspire to sell something special and figure out how to reach your consumer in the most economic, healthy, brand-appropriate way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jcdebkb729xqjnwmhh7xaryb))
