## Highlights
- n many cases, Google’s ecosystem inherently disadvantages smaller brands, particularly those with constrained budgets competing in saturated markets where established brands are overbidding to dominate impression share (sometimes at a loss). If your bids are too low to test, you risk failing to generate a sufficient volume of clicks to achieve conversions or reach your target cost-per-acquisition (CPA), all while fixed costs are ticking along. For lower average order value (AOV) products in competitive markets, this is where it’s very challenging. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg408k3hf2vk559khpqygmfg))
- However, P-Max bids on both branded keywords, non-branded keywords and also retargets: this means going after users who have previously bought your product. In order to fully exploit sales from net-new customers, account managers need to add branded exclusions to P-Max campaigns to ensure it doesn’t over-leverage existing customers.

- Since the iOS14 privacy changes, D2C brands are focusing far more on creative strategy and creative design rather than campaign structure. Today, founders are relying heavily on AI driven campaigns (instead of interest-based) and focusing their energy on creative development.

- That said, brands, particularly those operating in competitive markets, have found success on Facebook through strong creative execution, compelling unique selling propositions (USPs), and often a superior product experience or impressive lifetime value. For emerging brands, Facebook serves as an accessible gateway to gauge public interest with the hope their efforts deliver results.
