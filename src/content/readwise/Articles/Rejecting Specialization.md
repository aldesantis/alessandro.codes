## Highlights
- We think that the primary function of positioning is for the market - for clients to better discover and hire you. But I’d argue that positioning is primarily for your own ego. It’s an inner game of figuring out who you feel comfortable being, more than a driver of clients. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j04kwbjydhqaj5zh8mfsz0aa))
- We’re not just looking for product/market fit for our consulting work - but our consulting work is deeply tied to our identity and we need a way to make it sustainable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j04ky5dh8grscm3bkrdpbnkz))
- Good specializing is hard, because if you don’t do it well, you can end up trapping yourself. By creating a narrow positioning or specialization you make yourself more legible and understandable - you’re essentially optimizing for well-defined work. And well-defined work is less senior, less well paid and less interesting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j04kzzcae63s2254pfsmgrxr))
- A VP of product or a CMO doesn’t get that role just because they are an expert in product management or an expert in marketing. They get that role because in addition to some product or marketing expertise they also have a blend of senior skills - across communication, leadership, management, vision and the ability to get things done.

- Having an opinion is like having taste. It demonstrates a sensibility and way of thinking that is key when a senior client is considering a consultant for a project. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j05cq0wwktvfrtrqvbeth9rm))
