## Highlights
- To prevent “attribute overload,” brands need a clear, collaborative approach. Establishing a shared attribute “playbook” helps keep definitions consistent, ensuring everyone understands when and how to apply each attribute. This playbook doesn’t just prevent redundant or conflicting tags; it also makes it easier for departments to trust and use product data, no matter where it originates.

- Attributes are not a replacement for hierarchy but a complement. While the hierarchy provides a stable foundation, attributes offer the flexibility to add depth and nuance. When used thoughtfully, attributes allow brands to be responsive and innovative, without sacrificing control over data quality.

- Keeping your hierarchy lean makes it easier to adapt as new trends emerge, preventing the frustration of constantly adjusting rigid categories. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg3yj2113aw068w6sbmya4z5))
- Develop a shared “attribute playbook” that standardises attribute definitions, spelling, and usage rules. This playbook becomes a reference point, ensuring that all teams tag products consistently and in ways that align with overall business goals. By limiting and standardising attributes, you create a flexible layer of detail that’s manageable, accurate, and easy to use.
