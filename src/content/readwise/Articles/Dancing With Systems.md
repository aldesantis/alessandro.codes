- Summary: The text discusses the importance of listening to systems and understanding their complexity. It emphasizes the need to locate responsibility within systems and pay attention to what is important beyond what is quantifiable. Furthermore, it highlights the value of expanding time and thought horizons to navigate complex systems effectively.

## Highlights
- If I could, I would add an Eleventh Commandment: Thou shalt not distort, delay, or sequester information. You can drive a system crazy by muddying its information streams. You can make a system work better with surprising ease if you can give it more timely, more accurate, more complete information.

- Designing a system for intrinsic responsibility could mean, for example, requiring all towns or companies that emit wastewater into a stream to place their intake pipe downstream from their outflow pipe. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4sha2jef4n3qmsfk8n3c4e))
- You can imagine why a dynamic, self-adjusting system cannot be governed by a static, unbending policy. It’s easier, more effective, and usually much cheaper to design policies that change depending on the state of the system. Especially where there are great uncertainties, the best policies not only contain feedback loops, but meta-feedback loops–loops that alter, correct, and expand loops. These are policies that design learning into the management process. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4ska8h9gdxtr6nvkd9fs6x))
- If something is ugly, say so. If it is tacky, inappropriate, out of proportion, unsustainable, morally degrading, ecologically impoverishing, or humanly demeaning, don’t let it pass. Don’t be stopped by the “if you can’t define it and measure it, I don’t have to pay attention to it” ploy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4sm3r4grx4y75t71feh3ar))
- As you think about a system, spend part of your time from a vantage point that lets you see the whole system, not just the problem that may have drawn you to focus on the system to begin with. And realize, that, especially in the short term, changes for the good of the whole may sometimes seem to be counter to the interests of a part of the system. It helps to remember that the parts of a system cannot survive without the whole. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4sn2wkaxtdjmws806evy7k))
- When you’re walking along a tricky, curving, unknown, surprising, obstacle-strewn path, you’d be a fool to keep your head down and look just at the next step in front of you. You’d be equally a fool just to peer far ahead and never notice what’s immediately under your feet. You need to be watching both the short and the long term–the whole system.

- Seeing systems whole requires more than being “interdisciplinary,” if that word means, as it usually does, putting together people from different disciplines and letting them talk past each other. Interdisciplinary communication works only if there is a real problem to be solved, and if the representatives from the various disciplines are more committed to solving the problem than to being academically correct. They will have to go into learning mode, to admit ignorance and be willing to be taught, by each other and by the system. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4sr2gaw236qsbggz84fy0a))
- Let’s face it, the universe is messy. It is nonlinear, turbulent and chaotic. It is dynamic. It spends its time in transient behavior on its way to somewhere else, not in mathematically neat equilibria. It self-organizes and evolves. It creates diversity, not uniformity. That’s what makes the world interesting, that’s what makes it beautiful, and that’s what makes it work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4sshtz4bqewnrfqsvenxwh))
- The idea of making a complex system do just what you want it to do can be achieved only temporarily, at best. We can never fully understand our world, not in the way our reductionistic science has led us to expect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb043kgadkfjpenwd4a5c7yz))
- Living successfully in a world of systems requires more of us than our ability to calculate. It requires our full humanity–our rationality, our ability to sort out truth from falsehood, our intuition, our compassion, our vision, and our morality.

- Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves. If it’s a piece of music or a whitewater rapid or a fluctuation in a commodity price, study its beat. If it’s a social system, watch it work. Learn its history. Ask people who’ve been around a long time to tell you what has happened. If possible, find or make a time graph of actual data from the system. Peoples’ memories are not always reliable when it comes to timing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb047qptbne1kpwrj7h88x6b))
- Aid and encourage the forces and structures that help the system run itself. Don’t be an unthinking intervener and destroy the system’s own self-maintenance capacities. Before you charge in to make things better, pay attention to the value of what’s already there. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb04btp4r5w8yv40nq5wt65b))
- Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb04d0qm3vjx4g84a8xyrpvt))
- Systems thinking has taught me to trust my intuition more and my figuring-out rationality less, to lean on both as much as I can, but still to be prepared for surprises. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb04eggnnq7nsh19nsad5bk0))
- “Stay the course” is only a good idea if you’re sure you’re on course. Pretending you’re in control even when you aren’t is a recipe not only for mistakes, but for not learning from mistakes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb04g26spv86ceygttdx45qj))
