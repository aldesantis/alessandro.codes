## Highlights
- If you capture ideas when they’re in the forefront of your mind, you won’t have to pray for them to come back when it’s time to write. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h196n1201pkj9bq3z4svttgp))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] 
- It’s easier to have unique ideas when you read things other people don’t. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h196nz8s0z0m2cvg7cb8r5gv))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] 
- When you practice the habit of capturing what’s already happening, you’ll find that you have all the material you need to start writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1975swhkd0bpsf0ry9px252))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] 
- The clarity of memory decays quickly, so we shouldn’t just save other people’s ideas. We should save our own ideas too. Until we have a central place to capture our best thinking, the joy of epiphany will turn into the anxiety of forgetfulness. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1977qy643kyrq8xg29p55vg))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] 
- If you’re stuck on writing, look back at what you’ve already written for inspiration– emails, texts, tweets, group chats, and Slack Messages. Ask yourself: “Where have I been writing all along?” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h197a7kp0rey491pzpv64t3s))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] [[favorite]] 
- • Conversations with **friends** help us discover surprising ideas that are worth exploring.
  • Conversations with **readers** tell us if an idea will resonate with our audience.
  • Conversations with **editors** help us improve how our ideas are delivered. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h197kt8dmnkt57pgxxp931k7))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] 
- “Friend Brain” is our natural way of speaking. It comes easily to us in conversation, and it knows how to party. It’s the friend your Mom warned you about — the one who was super mischievous and high-agency and gave you that intrepid spirit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h197tf2rx6cq5vq7pcyj4ybx))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] [[favorite]] 
- Until you develop a form of low-grade telepathy, your best bet is to cultivate feedback. By doing so, your writing will have less fat and a hell of a lot more meat on the bone. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h197zt6qh730s0qcwp0fwc07))
    - Tags: [[feedback]] [[Writing]] 
- Compressed writing doesn’t mean short (just look at the length of this guide!). It just means that the pacing is brisk and each word serves a unique purpose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1982rdqzt6fqyar9cqber4h))
- A fraction of what you initially write will account for the majority of insight. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1982zz1kphca23d0wvqxcdt))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] [[creativity]] 
- Ideas that are novel but not surprising are the definition of trivia (which sounds a lot like trivial for a reason). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1984135ppcsxkee45ww2kyv))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] [[creativity]] 
- You can buy attention, but you can’t buy trust. It has to be earned, and that’s what makes it so precious. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h198777jcxpagt7pmqyw84fh))
- The best self-promoters aren’t self-promoters. They take the time to become a genuine member of each community. Share others’ content. Write detailed comments. Make friends. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h198ec6fg9h2vxxkjh1ke9rh))
- Writing online without building an email list is like playing Monopoly, passing GO, and not collecting $200. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h198ns397t7myqz6mbck80cv))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] [[newsletters]] 
- Good writing has three components: it’s Personal, Observational, and Playful. Writing that feels stale is almost always lacking in one of these three dimensions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h198xr8gqzcc46946pecrq8k))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] 
- When writing is only observational, it’s boring. School textbooks come to mind because they are neither personal or playful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h198zgsrn7ckeqhbyhvhks9t))
- A shiny dime is the smallest viable idea you can write about. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1990x66majek51yh5hev4nz))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] 
- If you have a distinct voice, you don’t need to have all the answers because readers will enjoy going on the journey with you so much. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1993wn3rmscs1r36scw03zb))
- You ain’t gonna think your way to finding your voice. Don’t get upset with your lack of progress until you’ve published at least 50 articles. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1996pw2xxwn4t948rffngxa))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] 
- Nobody has ever recommended a book because there weren’t any typos. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h199atvcayqmpan55fqe5aja))
- Writing tools often lower variance which is good if you’re a bad writer and bad if you’re a good writer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h199cardefwp4dtcgqdggggy))
    - Tags: [[Writing]] 
- A busy schedule will suffocate your spirit, but [free time is nuclear fusion for creativity](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1558117720180379648?s=20&t=3tD0VtUrBnkWreYtVxDKvg). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h199k7m4spvn1d6ph02srhj1))
    - Tags: [[creativity]] 
- If your ideas are boring, get a life. If you already have a life and your ideas are still boring, you’re not listening carefully enough. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h199jw7g5zwqppx4dev349ag))
