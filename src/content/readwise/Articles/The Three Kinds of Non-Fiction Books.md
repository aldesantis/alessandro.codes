## Highlights
- Narrative books are books that tell a story. Examples include biographies, memoirs, and histories.

- Tree books are books that lay out a framework of ideas.

- Branch books are the most common type of book you'll find in the non-fiction section. These are books that consist of a single idea. The rest of the book is then padded out with examples, extrapolations, and implications of that single idea.

- The ideas in a branch book can often be hung up on the framework developed by a tree book.

- The key feature of branch books, for me, is that you can easily summarise them. Which then implies that if someone has written a good summary of a branch book, you can read the summary instead of reading the full book.
  This is a useful thing to know. Conversely, tree books and narratives are difficult to summarise. And I'd warn against reading summaries of those books in lieu of reading the actual text: too much gets lost in translation.

- There's another implication here: you can skim branch books. You shouldn't skim narratives and tree books.
  With tree books in particular, I find that slowing down to reflect on each chapter to be incredibly rewarding, so long as the tree book is a good one.
  But branch books: man. It's absolutely possible to skim branch books while still maintaining an optimal amount of learning.
