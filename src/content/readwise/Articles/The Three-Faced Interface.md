summary: |
  The text discusses how corporate personhood is evolving in the age of AI, with interfaces becoming more complex and invasive. It touches on how digital interfaces are replacing physical ones, and how AI is shaping the way we interact with corporations and their interfaces. The text also highlights the concept of "personified" corporate personhood, where corporations attempt to present a more human-like face to the public through technology.

## Highlights
- You don’t see your neighbour cutting the throat of a goat any more. You see them with a bag of groceries containing plastic-wrapped, industrially-farmed beef cutlets. This increased indirectness dilutes the intensity of day-to-day life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g2hk0krd8zep7jx6bjz2cq))
- Nevertheless, because a corporation is an artificial legal person operated by real people, we always have two separate ways we can experience it. We can experience the real people, for example, by chatting to the clerk at Walmart. Alternatively, we can experience the legal person, by noticing that the clerk has a branded uniform over her real body, and that this specific building is arranged in a particular way that represents a universal Walmart-ness that transcends this specific place. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g2p0qwq77atz3zhja8jbgt))
- A large-scale capitalist system always *defaults* to expansion and acceleration, and if you attempt to go against this trajectory you eventually get shafted. Predictably then, the original horizontal Internet got shafted by the expansionary, accelerationist version. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g2v86ahgtbc9ddn78v8x6e))
- The YouTube you see has the same colours and layout as the one I see, and yet we’re not present in each other’s space like two customers browsing through the same record collection at a music store. The Internet is seldom used to ‘connect us together’ any more. No, we’re each in a private bubble. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g2zs73t8wv07tc9g5b16nw))
- In recent years this mirroring sometimes turns in ‘your year in review’ summaries, like Spotify Wrapped. Strangely, this is the only time you can detect the one-way glass. In so overtly saying *here’s a packaged image of you*, you sense the presence of a watcher. “We’ve been watching your every move around our music store… sorry, *your music store*”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g30yy8gr6130pwfk584s4y))
- A tech startup is like a nascent speck in the universe until the systemic forces of capitalism decide to channel through it and it explode it outwards into a mega-star in a matter of months. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g3p3tknjcda1b3w2twhgn3))
- Just like Microsoft Windows is a default that loads without anyone choosing it, corporate capitalism is an operating system that loads up every morning. You don’t have to *choose* to expand, automate and accelerate. Those are default processes that play out regardless of your desire. The role of the tech CEO is to extend the systemic default, cheered on from behind by a sycophantic class of institutional shareholders.
