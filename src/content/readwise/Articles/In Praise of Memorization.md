## Highlights
- The point is that memorizing data gives you a bank of material to run through when forming and testing a hypothesis. When you rely solely on analysis as a form of knowledge-synthesis, you'll often reach the wrong conclusions simply because you do not have good data to base your deductions on. Of course you can and should research, but you'll be much more accurate much more quickly when you've got the information in your head at hand.
