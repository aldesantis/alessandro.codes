- Summary: "It’s not that we don’t have time. It’s that we don’t have time for the things that are really important.

## Highlights
- It’s not that we don’t have time. It’s that we don’t have time for the things that are really important. There’s always enough time to do what’s really important, but we get caught up doing things that aren’t important. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrhx6c8q1zs276fmv3eps6p))
- I prefer things that are better when bought used. There are some things that get worse when they get a little use, and others that get better, and I prefer the latter. Books, houses, furniture, paintings, pottery. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrhxhprh60pvm1x8wpr3cag))
- Consistency is the reward. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrhxv6msrw0j9j5jxzmaq5w))
- It can be difficult to appreciate how much simply avoiding the standard ways of failing dramatically increases the odds of success. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrhy0pa3xrspxzzy2nxpz4s))
- Winning without luck requires doing ordinary things for an extraordinary amount of time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hxrhy4dsm2shvb96j8k4ytpb))
