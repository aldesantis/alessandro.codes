## Highlights
- I was struck that at a recent gathering of billionaires, one asked the other nine: “From 1-10, how happy are you when you wake up in the morning?” None of them had a number above 6. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1v3tey0t3p8h4czf3wmmvkx))

- Next I suggest that **YOU** get to decide what’s a game and what isn’t, what needs to be taken seriously and what doesn’t. Life doesn’t come prelabeled as *serious* and *not serious.* You are the labeler. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1v3y4kpjjmvdek4g11r6yhw))

- If your identity is so fragile that a stock trade, a lost deal, your boss’s disapproval or your partner’s tone of voice throws you into a tailspin **you’re not a very conscious leader at that moment**. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1v3za95ppwv0g9p51nkw7t1))

- They know that often winning is out of their control but learning is under their control. They play the game to learn and grow. The game, including the points, is a constant source of feedback. And they are feedback junkies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1v452xbse7a7r3grhy051as))

- Sufficiency is the experience that there is [enough](https://conscious.is/15-commitments/enough). Life, and this game, does not need to be zero-sum. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1v469a5pnm260a6b443wv8w))

- Oneness means that they have a direct, deep, and profound experience that what affects the other affects them and vice versa. The deepest reality for them is that there is no *other.* There is no one over there to crush. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1v46awhg49ms1j0ym4bp9ta))
