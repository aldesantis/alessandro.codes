## Highlights
- Advantages of zero party
  data:
  It’s accurate. It’s provided by a customer,
  so you know the source.
  It respects the customer’s privacy. Zero
  party data is freely given. The customer
  is aware they’re providing it – no creepy
  factor here.
  There’s no limit to what you can find out.
  The type of information you collect is only
  limited by your imagination.
  Drawbacks to zero party
  data:
  Customers expect a value exchange. If you
  ask for some information, the customer
  will expect something in return. If you don’t
  deliver, you can annoy (or even drive away)
  your customer.
  Disconnect between what a customer
  thinks and what they truly want.
  Customers might think they want one
  thing, but they’d actually prefer something
  else. Some purchase decisions are made
  subconsciously. Zero party data can’t help
  there.
  When and where to collect zero party
  data:
  • New customer registration
  • Mailing list registration
  • Social media
  • On your site via quizzes, tools, surveys,
  etc.
  • Via email
  • Customer service interactions
  • In-store, especially with blended
  online/offline experiences
  How to use zero party data:
  • Personalized communications
  • Product recommendations
  • Personalized homepage or shopping
  experience ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3kqbtcgjrsxjgfbc7xmhypj))

- Advantages of second party data:
  • Additional information. It can fill in gaps not addressed by your first party data.
  • Ready to use. You’re purchasing data that’s already collected, so you don’t need to wait to collect enough data to use (as might be the case with first party data).
  • The supplier (and possibly collection method) is known. You’re buying data directly from the company that collected it. There’s no intermediate party. That means you can audit how they collected the data, and be sure it was done in a legitimate and compliant manner.
  Drawbacks of second party data:
  • Limited datasets. The data is being purchased from a single company, which means there are limits to how much data can be collected.
  • You need to trust the supplier. Since you didn’t collect the data yourself, you have to trust that they’ve gathered the data legitimately. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h3kqdb4tbn4fegcs1ye8jspw))
