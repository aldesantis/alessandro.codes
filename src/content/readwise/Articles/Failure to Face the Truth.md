## Highlights
- Once you start seeing the pattern of “failure to face the truth,” you see it everywhere. In almost every meeting, someone is thinking something and not saying it, even though one of the [best uses of a meeting](https://longform.asmartbear.com/productive-meeting-activities/) is to unveil and discuss insights.

- It’s hard to tell the truth to someone’s face. It’s hard to realize that your industry has completely shifted, and it’s *really* hard to say that out loud in front of the whole company. It’s hard to say “no” to a customer when you have bills to pay, and it’s hard to make a major strategic choice, because what if you’re wrong?
