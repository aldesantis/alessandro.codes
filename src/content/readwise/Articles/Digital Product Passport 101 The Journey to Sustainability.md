## Highlights
- What data is stored in a digital product passport?
  The EU is still mapping out all the data requirements, which includes standardizing definitions and data collection practices. However, here are some examples of what the DPP is likely to include:
  • **Basic** [**product data**](https://www.inriver.com/resources/what-is-product-data-syndication/)**:** Product name, make, model, batch number, manufacturing date, and warranty details.
  • **Material data:** Including origins of raw materials and components, plus the suppliers involved in sourcing.
  • **Ownership data:** Details on current and past owners (especially relevant for long-lasting products that can be sold and resold).
  • **Repair data:** Information about the overall repairability of the product, plus specific repair events and reasons.
  • **Sustainability data:** Such as the carbon footprint of the manufacturing and distribution processes, as well as the use phase. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hppn3r9cxfbxpb5ec759g00s))
- The DPP signals the end of that era. Companies will no longer be able to operate without having a deep understanding of the design, production, use, and recycling phases of their products. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hppn5b0sjqna422ggtrpeqx4))
