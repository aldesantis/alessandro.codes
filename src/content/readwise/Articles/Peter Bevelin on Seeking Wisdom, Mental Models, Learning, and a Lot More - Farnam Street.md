## Highlights
- Some kind of representation that describes how reality is (as it is known today) – a principle, an idea, basic concepts, something that works or not – that I have in my head that helps me know what to do or not. Something that has stood the test of time.
- Reality is that we get what we reward for. What works is making sure we reward for what we want to achieve.
