## Highlights
- Excellent CEOs endeavor to minimize the effect of biases by instituting such processes as preemptively solving for failure modes (premortems), formally appointing a contrarian (red team), disregarding past information (clean sheet), and taking plan A off the table (vanishing options).

- Excellent CEOs commit to making the team productive by regularly taking stock of and improving its operating rhythm, meeting protocols, interaction quality, and dynamics.

- companies that are both fast and stable are nearly three times more likely to rank in the top quartile of organizational health than companies that are fast but lack stable operating disciplines.

    - Note: You become fast and stable through an operating cadence.
- Excellent CEOs increase their companiesâ€™ agility by determining which features of their organizational design will be stable and unchanging (such features might include a primary axis of organization, a few signature processes, and shared values) and by creating dynamic elements that adapt quickly to new challenges and opportunities (such elements might include temporary performance cells, flow-to-work staffing models, and minimum-viable-product iterations).

- The best leaders reframe the reference point for success.
    - Note: Success means something different for everyone. Don't play by the rules.
- Data shows that externally hired CEOs are more likely to move with boldness and speed than those promoted from within an organization.
