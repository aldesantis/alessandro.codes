## Highlights
- I like plans where the value is obvious. Build another product that our existing customers would like to buy. Save $100,000. Make it way easier to get started using our product. I don’t like plans where the goals are abstract – take a strategic position in the market, explore new buyers, showcase our AI strategy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5p91f3wwbepcwc1v74j2m5g))
- I like plans that don’t require getting lucky. I like doing stuff that customers promise they’ll pay for, or are already paying for – I don’t like re-establishing product-market fit. I like plans that don’t require future technology breakthroughs, because I’ve seen that even geniuses have dry spells. I like plans that don’t require customers, partners, suppliers, regulators, or competitors to do anything dramatically differently – I assume that it is hard to change other people’s minds, because I know it’s hard for them to change mine. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5p92byg83w07h78ytvfjr77))
- I like plans that sound dumb to our team because they feel obvious, but sound dumb to outsiders because they require a worldview that only *our* team deeply understands. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5p92pkhbp48kymm62h1h5q6))
