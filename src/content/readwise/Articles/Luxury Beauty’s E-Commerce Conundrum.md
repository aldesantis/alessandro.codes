## Highlights
- “You have to over-invest. Beauty is more than just a purchase,” she says. “It’s about the experience you get. It’s about the content that comes with it. It’s about education. You could also argue that beauty online has become so commoditized that it just becomes about price. So, if I’m buying a product at one website, then I’m just going to buy it from somewhere else.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jaa8m0d0s1bhwvtrw3qsg0v3))
- “As soon as one player discounts a product, even by one cent, it appears among online search results,” he says. “So, as the number of players offering the same products increases, the acquisition cost of a client becomes more and more expensive.

- You also have Amazon, too, but I don’t think that becomes a discovery destination for luxury beauty brands.
