## Highlights
- **By developing new ways to show up by breaking category and even industry boundaries, innovative ways of business are allowed to be conducted.** In other words, the new generation of shoppers want their favourite brands to show their commitment to them by going beyond just fashion, and they want brands to put their money where their mouth is by allowing customers to experience the brands across all five senses.

- Brand Universes capitalise on the erosion of the lines that once divided category and industries. This expansive approach goes beyond focusing solely on product functionality or positioning nor is the expansion purely a business growth decision. Instead, its mission to diversify its revenue streams centres on conveying an extremely strong point of view, a holistic message, and value whenever, wherever it shows up. **It offers consumers diverse entry points, creating a “choose-your-own-adventure” path of brand interaction allowing the brand to play a more significant role in their lives.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz25w7hvv10q1ynvhx6tgky3))
