## Highlights
- â€¢ Identify all the key stages customers go through, from initial awareness and through the funnel to purchase, retention/nurture, expansion, etc.
  â€¢ Map these out on Figma, Miro, or whatever other tool youâ€™d prefer.
  â€¢ Define the primary goals, friction points, and engagement opportunities for each stage and how your retention strategy can help thoughtfully drive them through the funnel once you have their contact info.
  â€¢ Develop targeted plays and campaigns tailored to each lifecycle stage rather than batch-and-blast tactics.
  â€¢ Bonus: Leverage AI and machine learning for smarter segmentation and content recommendations (side note: Yotpo offers some of this). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzrvg47qd1qmngfh5zqe66r0))

  3. Are customers of one product journey much higher LTV than another one? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzrvfzyw1mwwzy5brjyjjgbt))
