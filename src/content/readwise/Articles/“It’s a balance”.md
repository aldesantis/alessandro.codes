## Highlights
- “It’s a balance”
  **This is the correct approach when both extremes are bad.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4v5jg2prk1hv0b3p2dpwg3))
- “Work vs Rest” is common example. Athletes who overtrain, don’t achieve peak performance. Athletes with natural talent who don’t train, will never become great. Athletes therefore need a system that intelligently alternates training and rest.
  We’re tempted to call this a “balance,” but I reject that word because it can imply “equal parts of each,” which is rarely optimal. It is not only the *right* amount of each, but also combined with a system that forms an integrated solution. So for an Olympic athlete it’s not “equal training and rest,” but a plan that results in peak performance on the critical day when they will contest the gold medal. The “right system” will vary by person, by goals, and by circumstance. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4v5tr4372xqb8m9679zp3t))
- “Zero-sum games” are another class of puzzle that falls into this domain—where more of one thing necessarily means less of the other. Time and money are often like this; when you spend time or money on something, it means you’re not spending it on something else. So if the question is whether a solo founder should be spending time on product or marketing—making stuff or selling stuff—the answer [has to be something like](https://longform.asmartbear.com/product-market-fit-formula/) “a balance,” but it doesn’t splitting time equally. It depends on what the company needs more right now: more new customers, or retaining existing customers. Or stated in the negative: Whether the biggest problem right now is that customers are rejecting the product, or that not enough potential customers are trying it.

- “It’s a choice”
  **This is the correct approach when both extremes are rational, yet contradictory.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4v6akz9grex4ydamwehah5))
- When the extremes are bad you seek a balance, but when the extremes are both rational choices, it is not a *balance* but rather a *choice*, and choose you must. Trying to find a “balance” means “failing to make a decision,” which is at least suboptimal, and probably downright bad.

- **Often people claim “it’s a balance” to justify their refusal to make a decision.** Whenever you’re tempted to claim The Middle Way, pause to make sure that is the correct approach to solving the contradiction. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4vbmfqa2b2eqnq9g5xp37g))
- Synthesizing a new solution, which allows us to select “both,” but only if many other things are also true, is the most difficult thing to do, but also by far the most valuable.

- Often the press will focus on the “invention” aspect, and indeed that’s the most interesting and press-worthy thing to talk about. But the real key is the set of “other things which also have to be true6.” These additional decisions are what convert pure invention and wishful thinking into a complete strategy.

- the central idea of [*Blue Ocean Strategy*](https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Ocean-Strategy-Expanded-Uncontested/dp/1625274491/ref=asc_df_1625274491/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693465227026&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=15655197287935843831&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9028297&hvtargid=pla-318700082110&psc=1&mcid=56178674db62348fb13db63425b6f6f4&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwltKxBhDMARIsAG8KnqUlPAscTCb9JhSJSICR6vc-0YuAIfc7NFMetccl9l0lX9XFgrjjx0YaAmNuEALw_wcB&utm_source=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_campaign=longform.asmartbear.com&utm_medium=post) is to create a new category of product through a combination of choices that are “contradictory” according to existing categories, while also solving for profitability. Seemingly impossible, certainly difficult, but nevertheless a powerful result when it is achieved.
  The courage to make all of these decisions together, to accept the unique advantages as well as the undesirable consequences, is what creates the best business strategies in the world, and is the complete way of saying “why not both.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jb4vnjxsqvdrzabh5jzw8b73))
