summary: |
  The article discusses the rise of the personal brand in the age of social media and how it affects artists and creators. The internet has made it so that no matter who you are or what you do, you cannot escape the tyranny of the personal brand, leading to constant self-promotion and the feeling that what you are really doing with your time is marketing, not art. The system works great for record labels or publishing houses, who can hand over the burden of marketing to the artists themselves. However, the problem isn't that people aren't buying books or listening to music, it's that less of the money is going to the artists.

- Summary: The article discusses the rise of the personal brand in the age of social media and how it affects artists and creators. The internet has made it so that no matter who you are or what you do, you cannot escape the tyranny of the personal brand, leading to constant self-promotion and the feeling that what you are really doing with your time is marketing, not art.

However, the problem isn't that people aren't buying books or listening to music, it's that less of the money is going to the artists.

## Highlights
- Is the labor of self-promotion making art worse? It’s sort of impossible to argue this; the internet has abetted the creation and exposure of infinitely more art than ever before in human history. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyza5q47ja6s5y2540stznka))
- A society made up of human beings who have turned themselves into small businesses is basically the logical endpoint of free market capitalism, anyway. To achieve the current iteration of the American dream, you’ve got to shout into the digital void and tell everyone how great you are. All that matters is how many people believe you.
