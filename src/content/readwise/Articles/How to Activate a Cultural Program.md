- Most brands still do not integrate all their cultural actions into one continuous narrative. Instead, each cultural output is treated separately: more advertising than entertainment. This touch-and-go approach leads to brands losing out on the cumulative effect that separate pieces of cultural output (content, merch, collaborations … ) would have had if connected into one interconnected narrative universe.
