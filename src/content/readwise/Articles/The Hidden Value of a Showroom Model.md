## Highlights
- When DTC brands open stores, they usually start with popups. They’re shorter commitments and lower risk overall:
  • **Shorter lease term**: as opposed to the typical 10 year retail lease, these are usually 1-12 months
  • **Lower bar**: when a brand announces their popup, customers are usually a bit more forgiving if the experience, design, or assortment is sub-par
  • This also applies to financial expectations: since popups are usually smaller investments relative to longer term (ie “real”) stores, the level of sales required to achieve profitability is also usually lower
  • **Opportunistic**: retail tends to be something e-com leaders ruminate on without much action until they find the “perfect” space (usually a space recently vacated by a competitor, which requires little investment) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1bns03kdtp1yxjwtf3hkrf2))

- Whether you’re operating a popup, a “real” store, or even managing a wholesale account, inventory is a huge pain the ass.
  Cash and carry models (ie stores that sell products from the store; “traditional” retail) require constant attention and management ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1bnsrvn0h7bx478akrmfdj8))

- In a cash and carry store model, there’s a direct correlation between your sales, time spent on inventory management, mistakes, and other overhead — contributing to a lower profit margin and a diluted customer experience.
