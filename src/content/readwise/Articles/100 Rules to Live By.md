## Highlights
- **“Courage is a muscle that you need to train.”** — Picture courage as a muscle that atrophies if it goes unused. Courage can also be strengthened through [progressive overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_overload). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1nx74yn4d3f6qvhnq1c7jzm))
    - Tags: [[personal-growth]] 
- **“Business opportunities can lead to others.”** — Build something even if you don’t have a “good” idea yet. We find new problems by solving problems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h1nx8s7x4dg8ka10pvxe1np8))
