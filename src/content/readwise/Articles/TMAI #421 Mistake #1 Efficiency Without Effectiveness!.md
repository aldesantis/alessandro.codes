## Highlights
- Revenue is an **Effectiveness** metric. 
  So are: Market Share. Tickets Closed. Share of Search (don’t use this! TMAI #398). Site Visits. 
  They all represent the *degree to which something is successful in producing a desired result.* 
  Conversion Rate is an **Efficiency** metric. 
  So are: Add to Cart Rate. CPC. First Response Time. Attach Rate. CAC. ROI. Gross Margin! 
  They all represent *the ability to achieve a successful result with the least amount of resources*. 
  It is crucial to focus on both. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5dz6zevnd7de2jeap1p9wnp))
- I can be massively effective (50% increase in Revenue). But, without a need to focus on efficiency, I will accomplish that by paying crazy amounts in Cost – delivering the company an overall loss, while being *effective*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j5dz7d7b4gkv14rcd13k2enq))
- Anthropologist Marilyn Strathern stated that individuals try to anticipate the effect of a policy, and then take actions that alter its outcome. Alternatively stated as: 
  *When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.* 
  You can never entirely eliminate this possibility. Human ingenuity is a thing to behold when it comes to gaming the system. 
  But. You can create incentives to reduce the chances of Ms. Strathern’s postulation coming true. One crucial way of doing that is to create positive incentives via the lovely counterbalancing forces of efficiency and effectiveness.
