## Highlights
- Building a developer community and network effects is still a moat, but the value captured by these moats is lessened in a world where open source alternatives exist. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa3n3j69rndepq9e5xt5vf7))
- Best described by Metcalf’s law, your product or service has “network effects” if each additional user of your product accrues more value to every other user. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa3rbk3md6mvd5hkhfhqsd7))
    - Tags: [[strategy]] 
- Startup founders who succeed tend to execute a dual-pronged strategy: 1) Attack legacy player moats and 2) simultaneously build their own defensible moats that ride the new wave. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa3y6xh9aa6zxx1manvhn9p))
    - Tags: [[strategy]] [[startups]] 
- In an era of cloud and open source, deep technology attacking hard problems is becoming a shallower moat. The use of open source is making it harder to monetize technology advances while the use of cloud to deliver technology is moving defensibility to different parts of the product. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa40xg3jxqngnwsjh8g56hv))

- Perhaps the most strategic advantage of being a system of engagement is that you can coexist with several systems of record and collect all the data that passes through your product. Over time, you can evolve your engagement position into an actual system of record using all the data you have accumulated.

- For a startup to thrive around incumbents like Oracle and SAP, you need to combine their data with other data sources (public or private) to create value for your customer. Incumbents will be advantaged on their own data. For example, Salesforce is building a system of intelligence, Einstein, starting with their own system of record, CRM.
