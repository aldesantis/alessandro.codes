summary: |
  Crypto venture capitalist Chris Dixon argues in his book, "Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet," that the problems of the internet can be solved through blockchain technology. He believes that the internet's issues stem from corporate control and centralized networks. Dixon proposes that blockchain networks can decentralize the internet and give power back to the people. However, the author of the summary disagrees with Dixon's arguments, stating that the problems of the blockchain's technical architecture are similar to those of corporations. The summary concludes by stating that Dixon's arguments fall short of solving the internet's current problems.

## Highlights
- Competition for limited eyeballs is the primary driver of the power law. People pay for what they consider the best. If all URLs are competitive, then of course cyberspace devolves into a winner-take-most dynamic for each job to be done for consumers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hnn3zrc7680ma9pvpkz1gznc))
- Ironically, the very nature of the blockchain creates its own attract/extract cycle. I call it the attract/extract doom loop. A blockchain attracts new users to its network by offering financial rewards, with early users extracting the maximum amount of yield possible. As soon as the yield starts to slip below acceptable levels, users will loop back around by selling their position and moving on to another crypto asset that gives them the same amount of return they received previously. This dynamic prevents almost every single crypto project from crossing the utility rubicon to no longer needing to offer financial reward.
