## Highlights
- Teach how to decide, rather than what to decide.
    - Tags: [[Leadership]] 
- Tobi Lütke, the Founder and CEO of Shopify uses a concept he refers to as the “trust battery”:
  “It’s charged at 50 percent when people are first hired. And then every time you work with someone at the company, the trust battery between the two of you is either charged or discharged, based on things like whether you deliver on what you promise.”

- Try to ask questions that can’t elicit a shallow response. Rather than asking, “What do you think about me as a manager?” ask “What could I be doing to help you realize your career goals?”.

- “If you, as the boss, want employees to take vacations, you have to take a vacation. If you want them to stay home when they’re sick, you can’t come into the office sniffling. If you don’t want them to feel guilty for taking their kids to Legoland on the weekend, post some pictures of yourself there with yours.”
