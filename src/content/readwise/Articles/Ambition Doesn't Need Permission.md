summary: |
  Brian Morrissey discusses how Nike, once a leader in branding and innovation, is now struggling due to poor decisions and a shift away from its core values. The company's stock has dropped significantly as it overextends itself and focuses too much on direct-to-consumer sales at the expense of brand building. As competition grows, Nike risks losing its identity and market position by trying to appeal to everyone instead of staying true to its roots in athletic performance.

## Highlights
- Empires also tend to fall based on external pressures. The defining external pressure on Nike that Rogers details is the democratization of the modern economy. Nike is not just competing with Adidas, it is competing with all kinds of upstarts that can tap into similar supply chains that were once one of Nike’s core competitive advantages.

- What’s more a DTC strategy can often commoditize brands as the shift to “demand creation” means pouring tons of money into getting distribution. This led Nike to shift from its iconic storytelling to the digital marketing game, which is mostly direct marketing rather than brand building. The internet is built for price comparison.
