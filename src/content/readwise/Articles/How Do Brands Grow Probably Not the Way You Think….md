## Highlights
- The source of this claim can be traced back to 1990 when the Har­vard Busi­ness Review pub­lished “[Zero Defec­tions: Qual­i­ty Comes to Ser­vices](https://hbr.org/1990/09/zero-defections-quality-comes-to-services)”, authored by Fred­er­ick F. Reich­held and W. Earl Sass­er Jr. Accord­ing to this piece, the doc­trine of zero defect man­u­fac­tur­ing was trans­form­ing the world of mak­ing things, and these aca­d­e­mics argued that the phi­los­o­phy of zero defec­tion mar­ket­ing would trans­form the world of sell­ing things.
  Their pow­er­ful claim was that com­pa­nies could boost prof­its by almost 100 per­cent by retain­ing just 5 per­cent more of their cus­tomers.
  How­ev­er, Sharp takes a dif­fer­ent view to this often unchal­lenged pref­er­ence for reten­tion at the expense of acqui­si­tion.
  He points out that Reich­held and Sasser’s appar­ent­ly mod­est 5 per­cent drop in defec­tion is actu­al­ly a drop of five per­cent­age points – from 10 per­cent to 5 per­cent, which is a 50 per­cent decrease, or a halv­ing of cus­tomer defec­tion. Not quite as easy as first thought.
  But per­haps there is some empir­i­cal data to back up Reich­held and Sasser’s claim? Nope. Turns out it was just a thought exper­i­ment. It also turns out that this reduc­tion in cus­tomer defec­tion is assumed to be achieved at zero cost.
  In the real world, how many com­pa­nies get any­where close to reduc­ing cus­tomer defec­tions by 50 per­cent for no cost? Exact­ly, hard­ly any. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jeav3a7veyg26gtczmqzv2qe))
