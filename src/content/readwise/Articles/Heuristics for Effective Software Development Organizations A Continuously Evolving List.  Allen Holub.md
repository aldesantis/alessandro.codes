## Highlights
- The most effective organizations are learning organizations. Learning—about both the products we produce and the way we produce them—is continuous. Learning is not just a normal work activity, it is the work.
- Teams that depend on other teams cannot respond fast enough, so team members have between them all skills needed to get an idea into our customers hands. Skills overlap, so no single person is essential.
- Much of the dysfunction in managment comes from fear, which in turn comes from a lack of transparency. Our processes must be as transparent as possible.
