- This question confused me because I'm often trying to get *fewer* people to come to my events. Not because I don't like people, but people and problems scale linearly. It is more complex to organise more people. It is harder to find venues, it is harder to coordinate them, and it is more likely one of your participants will be poorly attuned to social norms and behaviours.

- My ideal community size is something like 8-12 people. Enough that if half of you are busy or sick one week, the rest can still hold a lively event. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jc6t9k96v5qgr1bz905zmmb0))
