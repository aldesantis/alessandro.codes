## Highlights

One way to kick-start this process is to give consumers a platform and the tools to create influence in their own local communities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01has02hcx0egqz3xpaf62qb68))
- *A brand pursues the portfolio strategy.* Rather than trying to cater to mass audience in a superficial way, a brand like Netflix goes deep and narrow in pursuit of niche viewers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01has04cjzcgjgyx85fe4e12pe))
- *A brand purpose is generative, not restrictive.* A brand purpose is defined in a way that it does not limit a brand to a specific category, but instead it opens up opportunities for future expansion and cross-market growth.

- *A brand cannot be confused with any other brand.* Companies that operate according to the economics of singularities - like Apple, Aesop, Tesla, Peloton, Uber, Atoms, Caskata - are gradually building their own incomparability.

    - Tags: [[ecommerce]] [[branding]] [[retail]] 
- *A brand is part of the balance sheet.* A company understands that it is in the business of cultural creation. A brand unites a company’s business and cultural side. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01has09hyjvkr2qxf2z5mw3z1c))
