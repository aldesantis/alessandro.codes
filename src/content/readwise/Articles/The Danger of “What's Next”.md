## Highlights
- *Next* will come in its own time, but *now* is more important. As a striver and planner, it is hard for me to not keep pushing for more. Learning contentment and peace has been a process. But over the years, I have learned to quiet that constant ambition in favor of seeing the absolute joy in where I am. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hz23s7b0apkjjqedwgca3fv8))
