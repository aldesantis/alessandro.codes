  Being assertive with customers is important for effective communication and business success. Collaborative personality types often struggle with being too conservative and not speaking up enough. This can result in missed opportunities and decreased revenue. It's crucial to find a balance between respecting the customer's agency and assertively guiding them. Examples of situations where assertiveness is needed include answering customer questions, handling feature requests, providing product/business context, addressing unwarranted complaints, and managing accounts. It's important to remember that being assertive does not mean being pushy, but rather taking the lead and providing value to the customer.

## Highlights
- If you take your hands completely off the wheel, it’s shirking your responsibility. Never put the burden on your customer to drive the conversation. Run the call. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hse8tvjgszh0ejjdkmaswzjr))
- It takes courage to engage in productive conflict. Your customer benefits when you are brave enough to speak up, respectfully disagree, and share information that may be at odds with their current knowledge. It’s uncomfortable for you in the short run, but when you do this emotional labor, it benefits your professional growth, your company’s revenue, and your customer’s business in the long run.
