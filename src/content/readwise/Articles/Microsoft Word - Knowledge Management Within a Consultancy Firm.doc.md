## Highlights
- In each project group a person titled “Knowledge Champion” is chosen as responsible for collecting and assembling data to ensure that the knowledge is extracted from the project and stored so that it can be shared with others in the organization. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j42r97asgam8zcmd9ykbane8))
- Accenture has regularly various formal gatherings where the employees have meetings to share knowledge and experiences. These meetings, if by working field, often take place about once a month and on a higher level within the country about 12 times a year. There are meetings by office, by field of work, by level of position etc and they all gather at different occasions during the year, some several times regularly others only a few per year. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j42rbqry6ve9mrq4shpwzzp7))
- Within the network of Accenture employees there are also different sub networks/communities divided into different work fields of the consultants. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j42rdfjtqwwrsa57p196vs9p))
- Within every field there are also “Knowledge Sharing Officers” whose role is to make sure that knowledge is shared and spread. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j42rcw3c1q5nqb7d9478j24s))
- When an individual is taken on by Accenture and at every promotion to a new level the employee is requested to participate in a course where new methods and new contacts can be established. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j42rdxjnpqe8gghcnhs049sp))
- All new employees get a 2 week long education in general consultancy methods at the training centre located in Chicago, USA. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j42re74gtffd7yzqjeh04kpn))
- Accenture has a database called “Knowledge Exchange” (KX) where all their information is stored. The search engine is web based and works as a source of information for company employees. Here the “Knowledge Champions” register their gathered information from projects so that consultants can search for old projects and material, and financial records etc. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j42rh1524t0pg077pf9yjdza))
- When asking about a perceived difference between seniors and juniors using KX the answer was contradictory. The junior consultants believed that the database would be used more the higher in hierarchy you moved, which stands in contrast to the senior consultants, who said that they believed that the database was used more by the junior consultants.
