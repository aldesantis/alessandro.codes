## Highlights
- Sure it’s constructive to “set your sights” on a competitor, actively trying to beat them in the marketplace or even steal their customers (e.g. give a discount if someone switches to you). But ultimately the **only thing that matters is that you earn more and more customers**, whether or not anyone else does too.

    - Note: There are some interesting parallels here with the concepts outlined in Conscious Leadership. Competition doesn't have to be a zero-sum game: we can use it to inspire each other and still all win.
- Big companies play only in big markets.
  It’s logical: With all the expensive machinery and bureaucracy it takes a dump truck of money and dozens of man-years to build something new, so the opportunity has to be enormous. Even if they *were* successful in a small market there wouldn’t be enough profits to move the big needle at the top.
  So Microsoft can’t attack a market unless there’s a potential to earn at least $1B. But wouldn’t *you* be happy playing in a market where you’d be able to rake in “only” $100M? Of course you would. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01h32fvwekebypb152nm73d3fe))
