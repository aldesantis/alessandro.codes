## Highlights
- “Leverage” means generating a large effect from a relatively small effort, created by riding tailwinds of natural abilities or hard-won assets, rather than fighting a battle for which you are ill-equipped ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa507yp3v8631qy9tev46b9))
- Leveraging strengths is the only way to do great work. (Not “fixing weaknesses.”)
  Better yet, leveraging *differentiated* strengths means you beat the competition.
  Best is when that differentiation is *durable* over time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa519j2g5awrqe0mv2c4w77))

    - Note: Lean into what you're good at rather than trying to improve what you're bad at.
- **Reversing weakness is hard, painful, likely to result in something merely neutral, not great, and is at high risk of failing completely.** Leveraging our innate greatness is “how we will win,” and “how we will win” is the entire purpose of a strategy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa53wfckffz015cqcr39y6d))
- Occasionally you do need to correct a strategic weakness in order to win. Not an operational weakness like “unstable infrastructure,” but one where you’re constantly losing deals to a competitor, due to a major deficiency in product or positioning. Something where we need to change “who we are” in order to win.
  A good strategy will explain why this risky, difficult, unnatural, expensive journey must nevertheless be undertaken, and why it’s the best way to win. There must not be many; probably not more than one. You can’t afford the time, people, or energy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa55b03hfjbc651z9scvwdj))

- Passion is leverage. Your strengths are magnified through sheer will, and that same energy helps you plow through the emotional pain and drudgery of working through challenges. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa58kacb3r7h6m0748fqb1t))
- The word for a durable differentiated advantage is a “[moat](https://longform.asmartbear.com/moats/).” Moats often take the form: “I have something that you don’t, and furthermore, you either don’t have the ability to acquire it, won’t invest enough to achieve it, or in the case that you try, you would have to make an incredible investment of time and energy and possibly brand adjustment to do it, which is unlikely to succeed, and even if it does succeed it will take years, by which time we’ve already won.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa5eyq6cmpp723a9xb9bafe))
- Finally, in a crowded competitive space, it’s possible that no *single* thing is completely unique, much less durable. A combination of multiple things *taken together* can be both differentiated and durable, so long as the constituents form a mutually-reinforcing, cohesive structure, in which a competitor who successfully copied a fraction of the structure will still not have created a similar product10. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01haa5jh9km7p0kr10nfxwns6t))
- It’s easy to claim that “our peculiar set of features makes us unique,” but that’s not strategic unless it forms a mutually-reinforcing network, including weaknesses. It’s not durable leverage unless a written strategy explains this network, so that the company can continue to reinforce the entire network with its actions and investments, including accepting the weaknesses, not treating them as “bugs to be fixed.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01has1gngy90k2bg95qnmxpd9w))
- Without leveraging *differentiated* strengths, the company will not surpass competitors, will have a hard time winning and keeping customers, and will have an even harder time justifying profit-generating prices. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01has1ht61zq4pjhqbrpp3t9df))

- Without leveraging *durable*, differentiated strengths, the company’s success will be short-lived, differentiation will be temporary, and once again it will be reduced to out-spending on marketing or lowering prices until it is unprofitable. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01has1hxtkwy9m2natghhbc6k0))
- A winning strategy explains which strengths the company will leverage, how it will side-step rather than “attack” its weaknesses, which strengths can be leveraged for differentiated sales today, and which long-term moats the company is constructing.
