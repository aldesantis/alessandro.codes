## Highlights
- “We haven’t found a way to make it profitable,” admitted LVMH Chairman Bernard Arnault at the group’s 2019 results presentation in January, referring to its e-tailer 24S. “All of them are losing money,” he said of competitors. “The bigger they are, the more money they lose.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgk73tbgk2xa0s369tf8y10c))

Five years ago, someone that looked at a certain brand would have said, ‘That's too classic.’ And now the same brand is extremely fashion-forward. So, the clues are not constant.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgk781000vacf5t9zwpkrbde))
- But the company’s laser focus on serving a specific, high-value customer has resulted in a clearly defined, high-end positioning and tightly curated, highly productive buys. “Sixty-five percent of the business is based on 30 top brands,” said retail consultant Robert Burke.
