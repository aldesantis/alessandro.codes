## Highlights
- “The omnichannel journey for us has truly come to fruition over the past couple of years. Direct-to-consumer's very fast growth also has a fast decline. We wanted another journey. Wholesale, own ecom, own retail. It was the journey that we felt was the best for longevity. When we open a store in London, we also see uptick on our dot com and our wholesalers there. In the past, there was a misconception that opening your own stores meant cannibalising relationships with wholesale partners, that’s not true. If you can crack the code of it all together and work as an ecosystem that’s where the power is.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyd5sbys5sqxqskk0xwa9n44))

So we always wanted to look for longer-term partners,” On’s Alex Griffin told us. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hyd5yak6nfkykxcqcymyc7h7))
