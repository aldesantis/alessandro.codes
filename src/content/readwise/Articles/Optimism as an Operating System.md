## Highlights
- If you walk in the door with a problems-focused mindset ready to criticise the client you’ll get rejected by the organization like a bad virus. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08fx4ag9b85v2xv7b3fwhr6))
- Remember - **consulting is humans all the way down** - no client wants to bring in a negative, critical or attacking consultant. And no team wants to listen to a consultant that *“has a better way of doing things”*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08fxe1rqyd7afj1c3cbjjj8))
- The strongest language you have as a consultant is:
  *“this is a solvable problem”* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08fz1zt4kd3af8e05xt953a))
- And yet - it’s humans all the way down and if you want to be effective in the theatre of work you need to recognize and participate in both the front-stage and back-stage environments of a client’s office. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08fzyzr3tz50hx6qmp49x2x))
- Show up in the back-stage of the theatre some-times but not all times. It’s important to give teams the opportunity to retain their identity and you shouldn’t overwhelm them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08g3xk1mj373ba637jwvjkm))
- **Although clients will rarely pay for it directly there is value in changing the energy and changing the conversation in an organization. These are precursors to real change**. And if you provide this level of positivity and optimism then clients will keep you around irrespective of your “impact”. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08g50gt9h1z34wafjdj4m0f))
- **the key when engaging clients is not to hunt for problems but to hunt for systems**.
  It took me a long time to learn this - that strengths and weaknesses are not in opposition to each other but rather they are in symbiosis. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j08g5xv4dvqkb4br1ark58ty))
