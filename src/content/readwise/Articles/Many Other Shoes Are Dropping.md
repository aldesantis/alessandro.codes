## Highlights
- Being derailed is not a bad thing though. Never being derailed is as bad as always getting derailed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g5jq55hqyfq3y9qsqyvhss))
- I think I’m something that could not have exited before the internet. I write connected skeins of essays that are somewhat, but not entirely, serializable, and do poorly when ripped from a hyperlinked context. It’s not great for archival, accessibility, or legibility at scale, but I think it is well-suited to making sense of the world in real time while also enjoying the luxury of a bit of poiesis through writing. It is living, breathing text of a sort only the internet allows you to generate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g5nh35tfmd44sc04bn9v3k))
- History is a messy thing. Theorizing it is difficult. If you’re lucky, sometimes things get easy or exciting for brief periods. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g5rjd55bx2gwq2bamwd8rn))
- If you yearn for a break from the past, history is very breakable at the moment. It’s not quite a liminal-epic evolutionary bottleneck, but it’s close. The fan of possible futures right now is as wide as it’s ever been in my lifetime. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j0g5vppsekyqjr8n66w6h7pk))
- Is writing to sense-make a useful thing to be doing? (for me, not you; utility to you is a side effect). If not useful, is it at least interesting or exciting? If neither, is there some other mode of writing that’s a richer way of being in the world today? If not, is there something other than writing I could/should be doing?
