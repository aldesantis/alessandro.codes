summary: |
  CMOs are taking on more responsibilities, including new tasks related to generative AI, but many feel unprepared due to limited resources and support. A McKinsey survey shows that while brand building is a priority, most marketers lack confidence in their company's ability to succeed in this area. Key challenges include internal silos, budget constraints, and a shortage of talent, which could hinder brands from seizing new opportunities.
