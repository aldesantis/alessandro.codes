summary: |
  Merchandise, or "merch," has evolved into a dominant force in retail, blurring the lines between products and cultural symbols. Everything from luxury items to toys can be considered merch, serving as status symbols and expressions of identity. Modern merch transcends physical objects to become a reflection of social and cultural values in today's consumer-driven world.

## Highlights
- Rather than being a retail’s side gig, modern merch has become its main act. Merch has always been a high-margin moneymaker, so a subtle but all-encompassing transformation of retail’s operating principle into merch makes economic sense.

- Merch’s original value has never been in the physical item itself – after all, a band shirt is just a t-shirt, but in the social and cultural capital associated with it. Partly this stemmed from the fact that originally one could only buy merch at concerts, thus signaling true allegiance to a cultural artifact. Thus, unintentionally, merch also operated on the concept of scarcity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hzn2akj502v8xfh5axrc8hs6))
- Merch is always a physical object and a symbol. A band t-shirt is a sign, and as any sign, it consists of a signifier and a signified. In the past couple of decades postmodern culture has been actively engaged in the removal of the signified in order to expand the consumer base for the signifiers, themselves valuable IP properties.
