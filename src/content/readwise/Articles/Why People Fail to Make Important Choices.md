summary: |
  The article discusses why people struggle to make important decisions and how to overcome this. One reason for decision avoidance is the fear of loss that comes with making a choice. The fear of making the wrong choice can also lead to avoidance and delay. In addition, it can be hard to make a decision if you don't know what you actually want. The article suggests that choosing well is a skill that can be practiced, and provides micro-skills for improving decision-making, such as noticing decision avoidance, noticing your desires, and practicing willingness.

## Highlights
- As Yalom puts it, “For every yes there must be a no, and every positive choice means you have to relinquish others.” If you are unwilling to face the loss that a decision requires, this can lead to procrastination and avoidance.

- Logic is important, but “wanting” is an experiential process. A decision can make rational sense, but still feel wrong in your gut. When you approach decisions in an overly analytical way, you lose touch with the emotional aspect of decision-making—which is the part that tells you what you truly desire.
