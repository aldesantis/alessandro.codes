- Summary: “I adore you, sweetheart. I know how much you like to hear that — but I don’t only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.

## Highlights
- I always entertain the notion that I'm wrong, or that I'll have to revise my opinion. Most of the time that feels good; sometimes it really hurts and is embarrassing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpejr3nte1aptxp7v92wc072))
- It’s the strangest thing: A lot of people as they get older get more protected and terrified. My desire is to keep throwing myself into things. My parenting, my relationship, my work. I’ll take the pain. I’ll take the joy. Because the feeling makes me go, I’m in life. It’s an enormous gift, this life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpejrakasdggk12g04j9c4s3))

- I was waiting for something extraordinary to happen, but as the years wasted on, nothing ever did unless I caused it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpejrtp74t0ykmmq1geq99rd))
- Sometimes success is going to the gym because you told yourself you would. Sometimes success is being kind even when someone doesn’t deserve it. Sometimes success is forgiving yourself for your mistakes. Sometimes success is avoiding regret. Sometimes success is a smile. Sometimes success is going to bed on time. Sometimes success is choosing integrity. Sometimes success is doing what you know you should do when you feel like doing it the least. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpejs9rvkhmp2y64xvzc5837))
- Your failures serve as a beautiful reminder that you were in the arena trying. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpejse2tf8y3r37p42e58dfw))
- Intelligent people know how to get what they want. Wise people know what's worth wanting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpejsfy9qkas1wedzxcpydm8))
