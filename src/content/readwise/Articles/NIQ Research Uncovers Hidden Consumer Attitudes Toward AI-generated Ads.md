- Consumers intuitively identified most of the AI-generated ads, perceiving them as less engaging and more “annoying,” “boring,” and “confusing” than traditional ads. These sentiments suggest that AI-generated ads may create a negative halo effect that could dampen consumer perceptions of both the ad *and* the brand.

- AI-generated ads—even those perceived as “high quality”—elicited weaker memory activation in the brain, compared to traditional ads. This reaction suggests a misalignment between the content and existing memory structures—a gap that could impede consumers’ motivation to act.

Coupled with the negative halo effect, however, this benefit could be outweighed by overall negative perceptions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg3yzpy063z85fgvyb8v10ch))
- Low-quality visuals in AI-generated ads increase the cognitive effort required to process them, distracting from the intended message. High-quality execution is essential for effective storytelling and brand communication. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jg3yzr8mknctxgerjvfg0p4a))
