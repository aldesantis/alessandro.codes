## Highlights
- What’s different about our stress response? Well, we have the ability to anticipate danger.
    - Tags: [[stress]] 
- But humans have evolved this [stress] anticipation ability to extend far beyond other animals. We anticipate bad things months, years, or even decades out. And when we do this, the very same stress response gets turned on—even though there is no immediate danger, and there is no immediate way to avoid it.

- Stress isn’t good or bad. It’s a tool. In small doses it’s good, but too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing pretty quickly.

    - Note: In small doses, stress increases our attention and focus. In high doses, it makes us more vulnerable to diseases.
- stress isn’t mathematical. Expose the same person to the same stressor and they will have different stress responses based on their coping strategies.

- Just knowing you have the option to reduce stress is enough to make something less stressful—even if you’re not actually controlling the stressors at all.

- Creating a vibrant sense of social support can put an unmanageable stressor into perspective and help keep it under control. Without social support, even small things can set us off in ways that are unproductive and unhealthy.
