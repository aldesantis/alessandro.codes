## Highlights
- Goal frameworks are useful when you see a lot of confusion or a lack of coherence in what people are working towards. They allow local goals to be aligned more with the central goals of the organization, and can help rationalize conflicting objectives and align parts of the organization that need to coordinate their work together.
- One of the bigger challenges with goal frameworks is that they simplify the situation. This is both desirable (as they simplify what to focus on, and get people aligned on that), and a curse (if you look back with a critical eye, youâ€™ll see most goals are trash).
