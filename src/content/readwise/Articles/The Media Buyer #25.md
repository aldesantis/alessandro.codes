## Highlights
- You are A/B testing minor tweaks instead of sweeping changes to your landing pages. I promise you that the font you picked for your product page is not affecting sales. Those sorts of minuscule A/B tests are popular for brands with billions of pageviews, which I'd guess is not you. Instead, focus your A/B tests on dramatically different pages, changing messaging, layout, product images, pricing. These big tests will show you very quickly what your baseline conversion behavior is.

- You're tracking conversion rate when you should be tracking new visits and revenue per visit. Conversion rate DOES NOT tell you how well your page sells. CVR is just a mathematical equation. If you optimize for conversion rate exclusively, you end up driving yourself into a corner strategically, leveraging coupons, on-page "hacks" and other tactics, instead of focusing on systems that will actually drive sales before people even arrive on-page. Look upstream to improve CVR.

- You're obsessing about conversion rate when it truly doesn't matter. Conversion rate is a RESULT, not a strategic or even directional indicator. If your page is not converting, you should be asking why, not immediately assuming you need to tweak your LPs or product pages. Expand your scope. Perhaps your LP isn't converting because your ads are attracting the wrong people, or because your pricing is entirely wrong. Look beyond the page.

- People are buying less stuff and you're asking the wrong questions. Ideas: How much of this has to do with your own landing page? What's happening in your industry? Does the drop in conversion rate exist across all your products and ads? Is this a larger trend? What parts of your business ARE succeeding, and what's the conversion rate there? What IS working and how can I take those lessons to my own landing page?
