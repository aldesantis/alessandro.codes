summary: |
  Influencer marketing in 2024 is predicted to be driven by authenticity and long-term partnerships. Brands are leaning towards longer-term collaborations with influencers, allowing them to have more control over the products they feature and speak about. Content is also evolving, with influencers focusing less on product reviews and more on integrating products naturally into their content. Livestreams, particularly on platforms like TikTok, are becoming more popular, as audiences seek a connection with influencers. Brands are also becoming more selective in their partnerships, choosing influencers who can provide raw and relatable content and speak intelligently about their products.

## Highlights
- I see a shift occurring where brands are leaning into longer-term partnerships, with influencers playing a larger role in terms of what products they choose to speak about and feature in their content and how. We’ve also seen brands start to partner with their favorite influencers in a major way, offering equity and salary-based roles such as ‘creative director,’ in exchange for sponsored content and expertise ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv7r9vcvp6741504047n3p5))
    - Tags: [[Marketing]] [[influencers]] [[ecommerce]] [[retail]] 
- Not only are brands changing how they approach partnerships, but content is rapidly changing, as well. Influencers are no longer focusing as much on product reviews, but, rather, they’re naturally integrating products into their spoken content whether it’s a vlog or a GRWM routine.

    - Tags: [[influencers]] [[social-media]] [[Marketing]] 
- Audience-wise, people are smart and can see through influencers. They trust those who have talked about a product numerous times, so when it is a partnership, it will make sense and become a lot more trustworthy. I see more long-term partnerships coming, versus one-off partnerships. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv7tf6w317394ctcg0zdr4y))

- It looks like content is shifting toward longer, vlog-style formats on platforms like TikTok and YouTube. Audiences seem to be more dedicated and interested in following creators on their day-to-day adventures. Shorter Get-Ready-With-Me videos and content reminiscent of the Covid era aren’t as appealing anymore ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hjv7v6hadsjyt309k7r8hswc))
