## Highlights
- Our brains are fried.
  And while it’s easy to externalize a lot of blame for this condition, we simply have to accept that we’re making goldfish look like meditative Tibetan monks.
  One hypothesis is yes, our attention is decreasing with prolonged exposure to digital stimuli, and we require even more intense stimuli to keep us engaged.
  Another is perhaps that while there is much *more* content available, that doesn’t necessarily mean *good* content. An onslaught of crap quality content may just require supplemental means to keep viewers engaged. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htyvemqjf22ktpjseev3dd16))
- We crave participation.
  And when we’re denied participation, we itch.
  Sludge helps us cope.
  We have no issues with attention as long as we’re *producing* the content. Everybody and their mother is a creator, we’re cosplaying Sherlock Holmes in the comments, and the medium of our moment is video games. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01htyvfbj4p93c20cttmyfpw40))
