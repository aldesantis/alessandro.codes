## Highlights
- **Bridging the Knowledge Gap**
  - Early-stage CPG founders need affordable coaching and community resources.
  - CPG Fast Track fills the gap between free Slack groups and expensive masterminds.
  Transcript:
  Dave Colina
  We feel there's a really big need for some type of coaching community that sits in between a super busy free Slack channel and on the other side of the spectrum, a $25,000 a year membership Where you go every quarter and party on the beach in Costa Rica and do ayahuasca with other entrepreneurs.
  Markus
  When brands approach me about like, how can I scale my D to C? Here's my meta account. Can you take a look? I'm like I don't want to take a look at that account right now I want to see your website it's just a challenge growing your customer base affordably that's a pretty common sentiment among
  Dave Colina
  Our community today is man like funding has dried up cash is pretty hard to come by these days how do I grow and how do I do so affordably and that's something I think we're able to lend a little
  Eric Dick
  Bit of insight to Marcus and Dave, welcome to the D2C podcast. This has been a long time coming here, talking about CPG Fast Track today. But maybe, Marcus, why don't you start us off by talking a little bit about how this all kind of came together. Give us your hero's journey, both you and Dave, in this space.
  Markus
  Yeah, maybe I go a little bit more back on my history. I, one of the founding members of Four Sigmatic, that company started 2012, so way, way back. And we kind of, those who don't know, we kind of pioneered the mushrooms, the functional mushrooms, not the psychedelics. And you might have seen a lot of companies out there right now with different mushroom products. But yeah, I was doing that. And we were sponsoring a lot of podcasts back in the day, including I think the most biggest ones were like Joe Rogan and Tim Ferriss. And then there was one specific individual called Sean Stevenson. He has this health model podcast and he was doing really well for us. And then there was a guy called Dave who was looking into getting the same podcast and wanted to hear how things are going. And during that time, there was a lot of interaction between the brands, like sharing knowledge, how is this podcast working for you and how is this not? So this is very common to be reached out by a founder asking, how's the performance been? And that was Dave. And Dave, you want to tell your side of the story?
  Dave Colina
  Sure. Yeah, I think that was 2016, 2015, 2016, when Marcus and I first met. O2 is a healthy hydration product. And that started literally and figuratively out of the back of my car in 2014. And so we were just getting into paid marketing. And was ready to splurge on a podcast. And I heard good things about Shawn Stevenson. I talked to him, really enjoyed our conversation. I was like, hey, can you put me in touch with another founder that has done your show? And he's like, absolutely. Let me connect you with Marcus. And that was the beginning of almost a decade-long friendship. And Marcus has been an incredible asset to me for several years. And as we went along through our respective entrepreneurial journeys, a lot of things unfolded, including the pandemic, which I'm sure we'll get into. And Marcus and I started to work more and more closely together. And a couple years ago, he approached me with this crazy idea of building an online coaching community for early stage CPG entrepreneurs. And I had just finished my second, I think, my second semester teaching as an adjunct professor of entrepreneurship at CU Boulder. That was like my fun night job, basically. And what they don't tell you when you take that position is you're only going to be teaching about 20% of the time. And you'll be grading papers like the remaining 80% of the time. And I rediscovered this love for teaching and coaching. But I could only do that, you know, from 5 to 7 every Monday night. And the rest of the week, I was just grading papers. So I decided to wind that down. And so when Marcus approached me about creating this community for online coaching of early stage CPG entrepreneurs, I'm like, hell yeah. Like, as long as I don't have to grade any papers, I'm in. And that was really the origin of CPG Fast Track.
  Eric Dick
  And I imagine even in the school situation, few of the people in the class were actually running businesses as well.
  Dave Colina
  Yeah, I'm surprised, actually. There were a couple that had some viable businesses that were already started. It was a really cool course. It was all seniors, and none of them were business majors, which I particularly liked because I was a business major myself, and I didn't get a ton out of that major. And the ideas that would pour out of these students were sometimes kind of crazy, but often pretty solid. And the way that the course worked was that you basically get paired up into teams of five people. And over the course of the semester, you work on your business. And it culminates in a Shark Tank-like experience at the end where the winner gets a check. I think it was for a few thousand bucks, something like that. And so I had a tremendous time teaching basically a lot of the stuff that I've learned through my time with O2 and especially what not to do and sometimes what to do. And it reignited that love for coaching and teaching. But man, I'll tell you, the administrative burden of professors and teachers is no joke. And so that was a fun night job that just stopped being fun, basically.
  Eric Dick
  And so you transformed it into CPG Fast Track. Talk about those early days. What sort of gap in the market were you guys discussing that you felt you could address with that product?
  Markus
  Maybe I can start a little bit like this goes back to 2015. So I came from Finland to US and I didn't really know anybody in the US. So and also the D2C information was kind of scattered around. You had to read a blog or maybe find some random podcast to learn about. But there was not like abundance of information out there. So there's all forums and I was part of e-commerce fuel, which you might know this forum. And in 2015, they had an event in Nashville. That was the year when I came to US. So I went to the event of Nashville. I started networking with people, meeting. Then we started joining different masterminds like Ezra Firestone. I think you've interviewed Ezra a few times. So Ezra had the blue ribbon. And that kind of kicks out of like, hey, this is the best way for me to learn and understand what's happening in D2C. So when I started reaching out to Dave about the idea of having some sort of community, I was benchmarking a lot of these communities that I've been part of and getting value out of. So then Dave obviously takes this information and starts spinning around. And then I'm like, okay, is it two of us? No, no, no. We need more people. So this guy is a connector. So he starts reaching out to other people. And Dave, you can explain how that ended up going. ([Time 0:00:00](https://share.snipd.com/snip/70d307c5-7a56-4b07-ba1a-80c4a91c9b5d))
- **CRO Audit Success**
  - Pilot House's CRO audit helped one member increase their conversion rate from 0.5% to 3-4%.
  - This demonstrates the value of expert feedback and actionable website improvements.
  Transcript:
  Dave Colina
  Your website's got to do a ton of work for you. And that reminds me of an exercise that we did a couple weeks ago with Pilot House, actually, where we had our members all on one call. And Brett from your team, who I understand is the resident CRO expert, came in and everybody got to showcase their website for five minutes. And Brett just went through the website live on his screen and tore it apart in a way that was incredibly constructive for people. I mean, we had one guy who Marcus later worked with a little bit closer, who increased his conversion rate from, I think, 0.5% to 3 or 4%, something like that, as a result of that exercise. ([Time 0:21:46](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6fc300a4-f25a-4a97-a9b0-6eab63bded72))
- **Omnichannel Approach**
  - CPG success requires a holistic omnichannel strategy.
  - This includes retail, optimized DTC funnels, and strong brand storytelling.
  Transcript:
  Eric Dick
  How are they thinking about Om-channel? I think like there used to be in 2017, 2018, you could hit the Facebook button on a nice website and you could kind of scale your brand up. But I feel like things today are a lot more holistic. You have to be thinking about multiple channels. You have to be thinking about building your organic presence. You should probably be making some local retail footprints and figuring out your retail plan. Like when it comes to CPG, what are you, are, is there still a formula that where brands are just going straight D to C and then kind of figuring stuff out, out on the way? Or what are you guys seeing from your cohort that's working well?
  Markus
  Yeah, I think from my perspective, it depends on a product because that's a really, some products are made more for retail. Some products are made more for D2C, like supplements. If you have supplements, I'm pretty sure we can make D2C work at least in some level, same as Amazon. If you have a canned beverage, well, Dave, you have one, it is always a little bit harder to make the math work and also get the people who are not used to buying canned beverage online to Buy canned beverage online. So it depends on a category. But we have great examples of people. I think you could actually, you worked a lot of it with Sumit. Maybe you can explain what he's doing because he's doing a really holistic job, especially retail. ([Time 0:22:55](https://share.snipd.com/snip/71a2729d-1adf-473b-927e-84f3caf9464f))
- **Lone Rider's Brand Consistency**
  - Sumit's Lone Rider brand succeeded with consistent messaging across all channels.
  - This created a unified brand experience, regardless of the touchpoint.
  Transcript:
  Dave Colina
  Submit submits a interesting case study he's got um a a brand called lone rider it's a it's a beer brand they've branched out into spirits as well based in rally north carolina and it started As a as a brew pub basically and over time they they grew that business where they could actually you know can their product and sell it in retail. And now he's got several brew pubs throughout North Carolina, one of which is in the Raleigh Airport. Another is in a place called Oak Island, which I'm actually visiting next week, North Carolina. The mystery of Oak Island?
  Eric Dick
  Is that the mysterious place? I think it might be.
  Dave Colina
  He's the only one way to find out and I'm going. But Sumit's unique in that he's got a retail footprint that's his own, so to speak. And he's built that into something pretty meaningful, so much so that he's one of the best and most widely known breweries in the Carolinas. I can't speak to his online sales, but I can speak to his online presence. And I think to answer your question, the brands that are doing best are brands that have a consistent message across channels. And so with Submit, you know, if you look at his branding, whether it's on a bottle of their whiskey or, you know, the brew pub or the website or a can of beer, it's all very consistent. It's got a consistent outlaw feel, you know, and that's something that I think has led to his success in that people know what they're getting when they touch Lone Rider. And this is often something we find overlooked, which is why we feel we can add so much value to founders at this stage, is just what's your brand all about? ([Time 0:24:14](https://share.snipd.com/snip/4b8abba7-1bc9-4fb2-8d29-17c85303b40d))
- **Brand Clarity**
  - Define your brand purpose, unique selling points, and reasons to believe.
  - Use the "Brand on a Page" exercise to clarify your messaging and improve consistency.
  Transcript:
  Dave Colina
  And there's an exercise that Marcus and I sort of co-lead called Brand on a Page. And this is a three-day exercise that everybody starts their CBG Fast Track journey with where we challenge them to fill out a stupid, simple PowerPoint template. I mean, I'm looking at it right now. It's got at the top, it's got your brand purpose. And then there are category table stakes. And you've got a couple bullets within that box and then a few areas where, you know, you're uniquely special and a few bullet points in that box and then your reasons to believe and your Voice actions ultimately leading to a positioning statement. We often can transform somebody's brand just by guiding them through this simple exercise. And so much so that there's one brand that's gone through our experience, also based in Canada, and she changed the brand name after going through this exercise. And there's just a ton of value in taking a step back and having other people look the consistency or lack thereof in your brand messaging, what's special about it, what's coming through, What's not coming through that probably should be, and taking that and running with it. And almost every founder who's gone through this experience with us has made some very tangible changes to their website and to their messaging. Some are talking about changes to their packaging as we speak. And having that unified experience throughout the channels is really, really important and something that a lot of people just don't have unless they have a ton of experience in this Space. Or ([Time 0:25:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/61307297-cb5c-486c-a47a-a52a256ea877))
- **Explain Your Product**
  - Clearly explain your product and its value proposition on your website.
  - Don't assume customers understand your brand without a clear explanation.
  Transcript:
  Eric Dick
  They've done it, maybe they've done a cursory version of it, but haven't really created the lens or the prism that they can then shine everything through, right? Whether it's your ads or your landing page or your welcome email, all of these things, if they're aligned in the right, with the right narrative, the right founder story, that's going
  Dave Colina
  To help. That's right. Because so often as founders, I think we get caught up in our own narrative and just assume that everybody understands how great our product is and why it's great and why they should buy It. When in reality, you know, aren't thinking about your product nearly as much as you are, right? And so being able to convey that quickly and concisely and consistently is super, super important, especially at this formative stage where you haven't yet scaled into the multiple Millions. But that's the thing that really allows you in my opinion to reach that next step and start to scale into the multiple millions yeah we see uh in this exercise we see a lot of brands who worked
  Markus
  A long time on making like a cool tagline but then when you look at their website they have the tagline on the top but then they don't explain where anywhere what is the product so you like You lose a lot of people because they don't understand but you have like go to the beach cool tagline i'm like yeah but you're selling a product as a can of something so let's explain what It is so like missing kind of basics and especially in the d2c experience like yeah we can work on the unique selling points that's easy but you start from what they're they're they're Brands and they have to tell what they're selling. ([Time 0:27:28](https://share.snipd.com/snip/41505b5d-159c-45b0-a43a-d0b1643afb61))
- **Podcast Advertising Success**
  - Four Sigmatic and O2 found success with the Health Model podcast in 2016.
  - This was due to its engaged audience, affordable price, and host's genuine product affinity.
  Transcript:
  Eric Dick
  But I just wanted to go back to one of the very first things you guys said. You were talking about the podcast. I know this was a long time ago when you were talking about podcast advertising, but you guys both coalesced on this one podcast versus some other ones. I'm always curious, what made that podcast the really good one to advertise on versus some other ones? I think you said it was the health model podcast.
  Markus
  Yeah, I'll take that. First of all, it was 2016. So there was not that many podcasts to be sponsoring for, especially in health and wellness. I think Sean was a perfect because it was in the right size. So there was not too much hype but he had a very very like engaged audience for the size so you can get it for an affordable price and you know that there's engagement so that's why it worked I don't know how it's working right now by the way so you have to go and try or find someone even better find someone who tried it but yeah back in the day, that was the case.
  Dave Colina
  And I think a genuine affinity for the products. I mean, I don't know if Sean still drinks or two and uses Four Sigmatic, but I know for a fact that he did at the time and loved both of our products. And that came through. That came through in his podcast sponsorships. And so, you know, regardless of which podcast you choose to sponsor, which influencers you choose to work with, I think there has to be a really genuine affinity for the product.
