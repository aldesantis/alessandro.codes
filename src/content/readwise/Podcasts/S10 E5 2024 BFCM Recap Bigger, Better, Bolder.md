  Welcome back to Limited Supply. Today's episode is going to be a little bit different because I'm recording this one on the fly. We are right in between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. There's a bunch of things that are sort of popping up and, you know, consuming people's minds. Black Friday, obviously, being the biggest thing. It looks like we've had a record-breaking Black Friday for Shopify, for Amazon, according to different articles on the internet, or actually according to Adobe Analytics, Shopper Spent almost $11 billion on Friday, which is 10% more than last year. And they're anticipating that Cyber Monday was going to be another record of, I believe, close to 13, yeah, 13 billion, which is also up from last year. I didn't realize how much bigger Cyber Monday is. I mean, I guess I see it individually, but I've never thought of that collectively. I've always thought that because it's retail on Black Friday, that it's going to be much bigger than Cyber Monday. But anyways, for today's episode, I want to go through a couple of things, obviously talk about Black Friday. I want to talk about some of the things I really liked that brands did on Black Friday that I thought was really interesting. Things that set themselves apart and sort of differentiated them from the rest of their competition. I want to talk about what I saw from a performance standpoint. I want to talk about some of the meta and health news that's come out around targeting specific medical conditions. And then if we've got any time left, we can chat about something called App Lovin', which everybody's been talking about. It's a new channel that is scaling usually as the second biggest spending channel for some brands in our network. So that's what we're going to talk about today. But I want to first talk about Black Friday. So from everything I saw, Black Friday was a huge success. Most of our brands were scaling on a daily basis, anywhere from 20 to 50% in budgets.

- **Beauty Brand Underperformance**
  - Most non-beauty brands had a successful Black Friday, but beauty brands underperformed. 
  - This may be due to offer quality or the difficulty of stocking up on beauty products with expiration dates.
  Transcript:

  Most brands that were not beauty had a pretty successful Black Friday. For some reason, beauty brands did not have a huge Black Friday, at least from the beauty brands that I had visibility into. I think that that was probably due to just the offer not being good enough or fresh enough or as unique. I think it's also kind of hard to just stock up on a lot of beauty products because they have expiration dates and seasons change. People want different shades of foundation or they want different shades of eyeliner or whatever it is. I'm not really sure. I don't do that stuff. But that is my hypothesis. Supplements had a really good Black Friday. ([Time 0:05:09](https://share.snipd.com/snip/7fc31db6-3177-467a-adba-d88d46b54af1))
- **Keys to Black Friday Success**
  - Brands that thrived during Black Friday were well-prepared. 
  - This includes having a solid offer, good UX/UI, email flows, ad creative, and a strong creator platform.

  Nik Sharma
  We saw a lot of good conversations in different group chats, whether brands were, you know, they're normally doing a hundred thousand dollars a month, they're normally doing a million A month, they're normally doing 10 million a month, or they're doing um you know we had some brands do 10 million in a day but everybody had a really successful black friday i'll tell you What the biggest commonality was about brands that did well during black friday they the brands that felt really prepared um going into black friday as in they felt confident that their Offer they had a good offer they felt confident in their website ux and ui they felt confident in their email flows, their campaigns, the ad creative that they put out. They felt confident that they had a good creator platform. Those were the things, those were the brands, I would say, that performed really well and essentially crushed Black Friday.

- **Prioritize Retargeting**
  - Focus on retargeting existing customers during Black Friday. 
  - Prioritize customers who have previously interacted with the brand, rather than new prospects.
  Transcript:

  They focused heavily on retargeting. They weren't necessarily going for prospect, or I should say like net new prospecting in the sense that they weren't going after people who had only just heard about the brand and then Decided to buy it at a deal or on a discount. Instead, they were going after customers who had interacted with the brand at some point before, either through post-engagement, through site traffic, through interacting with An ad in the past, maybe on social organically. And those were the customers that really came in. It was probably, I'd say, like a 70-30 split in terms of maybe even 75% of the customers that have come in are all customers that have in the past interacted with the brand at some point.

- **Brand Examples Shared**
  - Nik Sharma shares specific brand examples in a newsletter and Slack group. 
  - The examples highlight successful Black Friday strategies.
  Transcript:
  Nik Sharma
  So all three were really unique and really well done. But for today's episode, I actually put together a list. I actually wrote this in a newsletter and sent it out. There's a bunch of examples if um if you want to see all these examples i've got links for everything i'm about to talk about they're all doc send links so i'm not taking you to the brand Site because these um these site banners or the holiday shops or these drops or whatever i'm about to talk about has potentially been taken down by now because you're listening to this During Cyber Week or after Cyber Week. So if you want to see all the links for this, join the limited supply Slack group and we're going to put it in the general channel there. So it'll be there in general chat and either general chat or announcements. ([Time 0:10:33](https://share.snipd.com/snip/42949444-1ab5-41c3-aedb-97b8686a2a81))
