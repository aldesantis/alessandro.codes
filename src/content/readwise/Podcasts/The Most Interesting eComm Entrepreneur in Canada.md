  That's Z-I to try both out for free. You're the first person who's ever said prior to an interview that you were recently attacked by a pack of coyotes while out for a run or doing anything for that matter. And so I got to ask, what is the story with that? I mean, it seems like a fairly unique experience. And you seem fairly well and healthy now. What was the story here? What happened?
  Matthew Timmins
  Yeah. So I guess, yeah, most people I've talked to about this have never heard of this happening. So I'm up north in Canada where I am. There's some hybrids. They call them coy wolves, where I guess they've slowly morphed between coyotes and wolves over the years. So maybe it's not purely a coyote. But as I'm sure some of your listeners know, just with the e-com business owner hours, I have a young daughter at home. So I'm trying to sneak in fitness whenever I can. So I'll usually go to the work, you know, do the full day's work, then come home, have family time. And because I've been trying to push longer and longer runs, I've been doing them late at night. So I was out between, I think that this one, it was 1030, 1030 at night. And I was out north of where I live, which is Oakville, Ontario. It's about 30 minutes west of Toronto. I was running. And then all of a sudden, I'm running along. I see a coyote running beside me, kind of just, you know, it almost seemed like a dog. But, you know, we're used to seeing coyotes around. They're kind of everywhere, but they've never really been an issue for us. So I'm running beside and don't really notice anything. And all of a sudden it comes around and it squares me up and it's looking right at me, probably 15 feet away. And I noticed there's a couple other coyotes in the field behind. And so first thing, I kind of put my hands in the air. I make a lot of noise, just kind of try to scare it off. And it backs up for a second and then turns on its heel, runs straight at me, jumps up and bites me in the chest. Oh my gosh. I threw a punch. I was like, ah, and I threw a punch, you know, fight it off. And it, it backs up and it's coming at me again for another round. And luckily, a car is driving down the highway. And I'm having this melee in the middle of the highway at 1030 at night. A nice family. They don't speak any English. So the communication was a little different. But they're like asking me if I'm OK. And I said, yeah, I think I'm fine. Should be OK. And I start to continue to run down the road. And all of a sudden, I see them continue to stalk me. So I turn around, I get to do a 180 and I run back to the car and I say, you know, sorry guys, move over. I got to get in and, uh, hopped in next beside grandma. And, uh, they drove me a little bit down the road and I, and I hopped out and it was, it's kind of like in the movies where they say, are you okay? And I was like, yeah, yeah, I'm fine. And then the adrenaline wears off and I feel down and there's, you know, blood dripping from my chest and they kind of chomped, you know, once right there. So luckily I had a vest on cause I was doing longer runs. So I had the running vest on and my cell phone was right there. So it bit my cell phone through there and then still drew blood, but it wasn't too bad. So I ended up getting the four rounds of rabies shots just to be sure. Cause you never know with that kind of stuff. Yeah. It was a little crazy. So that was, you know, that was one of the, that was one of the bigger adventures of the summer. I'd say. That's ([Time 0:04:11](https://share.snipd.com/snip/6ec245e7-084a-4366-9ba7-698b843489ce))

  Well, I'm going to make a real hard right turn here. I'm not sure how well I'm going to segue into stuff here. We'll go from rabid, crazy, werewolf, coyotes into beds because you've got such a cool business. I introduced it at the top. Give people a sense of what you do. But I'm curious, when I think about the bed market, huge TAM, tons of customers, but also because of that, it seems like it would be a pretty brutal market to try to compete and differentiate In. So how do you do that? How do you set yourself apart in a market that you've got competitors that... I don't know how well they're doing now, but I think of the Caspers and the Purples of the world. They've just had investors just shoveling money at them faster than they can probably spend it. How do you differentiate in such a crowded competitive market?
  Matthew Timmins
  It's a good question. And it seems to be getting more and more competitive by the day. I saw there was a recent report that they were analyzing Caspers business originally. Just the overall lifespan of it. It was the equivalent of Casper was losing $100 per customer with how much venture money was being dumped into it at one point. So, I mean, it's also tough when you're competing with people that profitability isn't always the number one concern rather than just taking market share. For us, I never wanted to be a mattress retailer. I think that when you look to the layman looking at our site, you would say we're a mattress retailer. But really for us, what we do is we specialize in adjustable beds. So I always kind of aspire to there's riches and niches. I don't want to try to compete against every single mattress person out there. It's a tough business. And I think also just the overall average order size is small if you're just selling mattresses. So for us, we really specialize in the adjustable bed, the entire thing that goes up and down. So they have basically everything we sell as a package. It's the mattress as well as the adjustable base underneath. And we really focus on just the entire thing, the entire package altogether for one price. So that's been really helpful for us because our average ticket is way higher than a traditional mattress retailer, but also because we specialize in it, all of the beds we carry are Designed to bend. All of the accessories that we sell are meant for an adjustable bed. And we really just, we can focus on that specifically, as well as we're a manufacturer of adjustable beds as well. So we not only have our retail arm, but we build a lot of the bases ourselves. So by cutting out the middleman, we can just kind of offer some more direct to consumer prices. But then also we can add features, we can push features to market a little quicker, because there's not that gap between who's building them and what we're selling them.
