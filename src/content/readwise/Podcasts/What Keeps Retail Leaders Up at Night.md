## Highlights
- **No Guardrails, No Fear**
  - Amy Jain's lack of relevant experience in the jewelry industry proved to be a competitive advantage for BaubleBar. 
  - Her fearlessness and willingness to break industry norms led to innovation and growth.
  Transcript:
  Amy Jane
  So when we started Bottle Bar, I had no relevant experience for what was about to happen as we built the company. And when I look back, I genuinely feel like that was such a competitive advantage. I had no guardrails. I had no concept of what was right or wrong. I had no idea how it was supposed to work in our category. I was so fearless in our approach. I mean, we broke things in our industry that needed to be broken, but we didn't even know we were breaking them.

  2024 has been a doozy. On one hand, we've seen consumers continue to navigate economic volatility, rising inflation, rising prices at the shelf and digital shelf level. And we've also seen merchants, brands, and retailers try to adapt and respond not just to what's happening within consumer households, but what's happening within the four walls Of their businesses. We've seen rebrands. We've seen new partnerships, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, and brand comebacks too. With so many dynamics, it must be hard for C-level leaders to keep track, keep focused, and keep their teams motivated. That's why during the Retail Innovation Conference and Expo this past year, there needed to be a panel digging into these issues. Our e-commerce editor, Nicole Silberstein, moderated an incredible discussion featuring three C-level executives who had their heads down doing the work and guiding their teams Through this incredible wave of changing tides. The three executives in the hot seat, so to speak, were Nick Bogkens of Boisson, Amy Jane of Bobo Bar, and Karen Rabinovitz of SLUMU Institute. Three very different businesses, different business models, different contexts going into this incredibly in-depth and comprehensive conversation. Listen in. I hope you enjoy it.
  Amy Jane
  I often hear the feedback, like, Amy, that's so micro. Like, why do you care about this stuff? And I was like, I have such a different view to that. It's like, first, as a founder, and to be a great operator, you need to know your business inside and out. And then, in my role, my job is to make sure my team is so successful. And in order to have my team be successful, I need to know how the business works. I need to catch something before it's a mistake or catch an opportunity and figure out how to make it better for them. And then on the other side is every initiative we do, you know, is your most precious resource. It's your time. And so what can I do to make sure that if we put something out in the world, it's just even better than we had imagined so that we don't have to go find another initiative to kind of help drive Incremental revenue that way.

  - BaubleBar's customization initiative, driven by customer preferences, became its fastest-growing segment.

  Like very literal. Literally the things that you're writing down at night. And I don't want us to be like the downer session of the conference. And so I want to flip this around. And just if you can all quickly tell me one thing that is keeping you up at night in a good way these days, something that you are incredibly excited about, because there's a lot of challenge Out there right now, but there's also a ton of opportunity. So why don't we start with you on that one, Amy?
  Amy Jane
  Sure. So we say at Bobble Bar that our customer leads the design of our product. So we started an initiative about seven years ago called customization. And across now, a lot of our assortment, she can come on and put her own touch on it. She can make it her own. And this has been like a huge passion product of mine and many people on the team. And it's our fastest growing part of our business, but also just so operationally complex. Because if you think about it, someone places an order and you need to know where thousands of individual SKUs are during the manufacturing process and get it out to them.
