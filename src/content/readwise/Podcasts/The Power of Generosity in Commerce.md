## Highlights
- The Multiplayer Brand
  Key takeaways:
  - There are other content creators similar to the speaker.
  - Bricspace lab has a YouTube channel for brand breakdowns.
  - They have done tear downs on a sock brand launched by Robert Kardashian.
  - Critics often provide valuable insights.
  - The passage references the book 'The Multiplayer Brand'.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Interestingly enough, there's other folks making content like that out there in the world already. So just today or earlier today on Twitter, I had posted that there's a long time follower of the show of future commerce. The folks over at Bricspace lab. And so Thomas over at Bricspace, he and I think Ali at Bricspace, their Shopify shop, they have a YouTube channel where they do sort of brand breakdowns and they've been looking at this Series is like keeping up with the Kardashians e-commerce. And they're like doing Shopify store tear downs of different brands. In particular, there's a sock brand, I guess that Robert Kardashian had launched. And so they're like just ruthlessly tearing it apart for 18 minutes, like a total roost. Which comes back to the multiplayer brand and sort of the critique of it all in the space and how culture does impact commerce. Yeah.
  Speaker 3
  It was at Straight Out of the Book of Probes by Marshall McLuhan. Your enemies are your best PR. Like the critics are almost always the ones that provide the most value. And you're right. This is right out of the multiplayer brand. This is critique at work ([Time 0:09:45](https://share.snipd.com/snip/55c2b3db-643f-4d14-be81-f4229e0ca04f))
- How to Be Effective With Your Tactics
  Key takeaways:
  - In a seven year period, the speaker's previous company achieved nearly a billion dollars in sales.
  - The speaker emphasizes the importance of building a strong company culture and attracting talented individuals.
  - Adapting to changing tactics is easier when you have a capable team and a strong foundation.
  - The speaker often discusses the idea of building enterprise value in business conferences.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  So unbelievable. I mean, in a seven year period, it did almost a billion dollars in sales, which was, you know, it's just an unbelievable story in the evolution of the DSC space. But we were also very fragile that when we started to see some of the marketing approaches that we had used, not work anymore, that there weren't necessarily great pivots for us. So what I've tried to do with the current company that leads Simple Modern is build a company where the culture is really strong, where we attract really talented and capable people. And certainly we want to be effective with our tactics, but tactics come and go. If you have the right team, really capable people, they're going to be able to adapt and to find the effective tactics in any environment because you have the right kind of foundation. So that's, I think that that's the idea that I end up spending most of my time at these type of conferences talking about. I mean, part of it is that I'm not, you know, I'm involved in the business, but I'm not on the front lines of trying new tactics every day the way I once was. But also part of it is because I've been around long enough to realize that the things that will really move your business, because I think ultimately if you're building a business, You're probably trying to create what we would call enterprise value. Yes. ([Time 0:17:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/79629bc3-58bc-49f7-b394-aaefe86569ab))
- How to Maximize Quality of Life

  - Their focus is more on tactics and traditional data success than marketing.
  - They have not emphasized building stronger muscles in certain areas like marketing.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  They are constantly, people are going to be coming at them with offers and trying to peel them away. Right. And so the idea was for me, I didn't necessarily enter into simple long work. Hey, how do I make more money? I entered into it with how do I maximize quality of life? And for me, quality of life was meaning. And it was that the hours I'm spending at work, I'm spending with people that I would want to spend time with anyway. That's amazing. And when you start with that, then it takes, it's interesting how that transforms both the work that you do. It doesn't feel as much like work, obviously. But also the endurance and willingness to go through hard stuff and to make less money than you would be doing somewhere else. Like all of that stuff gets a lot easier when you're like, I really enjoy home in the trenches with. And I think it's meaningful. I think what we're doing is meaningful. And in our case, one of the ways that I think it's translated into success, because honestly, people listening to this, there's a lot of things that from my perspective, we do at, you Know, somewhere between an average to slightly above average level. Now there's a few things we do exceptionally, but there's a lot of things, especially a lot of the tactics and especially a lot of things that have to do with traditional data success, Like marketing, that we have not built a stronger muscles in because we ([Time 0:26:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/e55aae2f-8604-445d-92f0-d19d7abbd30d))
- The Importance of Culture in Data Success
  Key takeaways:
  - Focusing on culture, meaning, and purpose is key to success
  - Building strong competencies in tactics can be added later
  - Changing culture midstream is very difficult

  With. And I think it's meaningful. I think what we're doing is meaningful. And in our case, one of the ways that I think it's translated into success, because honestly, people listening to this, there's a lot of things that from my perspective, we do at, you Know, somewhere between an average to slightly above average level. Now there's a few things we do exceptionally, but there's a lot of things, especially a lot of the tactics and especially a lot of things that have to do with traditional data success, Like marketing, that we have not built a stronger muscles in because we didn't focus on them first. But the observation I would make is because we focus first on culture and meaning and purpose and building some of these other kind of like a sense of who the brand is and great product And a bunch of other stuff.
  Speaker 3
  You can always add the tactics. Right. You can always build some of these other competencies on top. Well, and there are things that change all the time anyway. That's right. It's like you might have, if you had built on tactics first, by the time you got to where you're now, you'd just be adding techs anyway. Exactly.
  Speaker 1
  And the culture is very difficult to change midstream. And you know what? I'm always empathetic when people are like, hey, I really love your idea, but I'm in this context where this is the, you know, situation and or we're really kind of a drift when it comes To culture. How do I fix it? And I'm always hopeful, but I'm also like realistic that it's like, it is more difficult. You know, it's always more difficult to take a ([Time 0:26:53](https://share.snipd.com/snip/3026c712-9a42-4604-acf0-46ffdb9796dc))
- The Power of Continuity in Building a Great Team
  Key takeaways:
  - Having a point of truth or voice of truth is important for the purpose of a project
  - Founder CEOs tend to outperform non-founder CEOs
  - Culture and purpose are key focus areas for building a successful organization
  - Exceptional retention can be achieved by focusing on culture and purpose
  - Continuity in team members can greatly contribute to a successful organization
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Be this. And that's not to say that things can't evolve, but you need to have some kind of point of truth or voice of truth about, hey, what is the purpose of this thing? What is it supposed to be about? And obviously the founding voice, I think this is one of the reasons that the research is really clear that founder CEOs outperform non founder CEOs. And you know, some of that I'm sure has to do with understanding of the business and buy in other team and other stuff, but some of it just comes back to they're able to speak with a voice Of this is what we're about. It's difficult for somebody who's a transplant or hasn't grown up through the organization to do it. So anyway, we've really focused on culture and we focused on purpose and then we built all the other stuff on top of it. And as a result, one of the ways to play it out is that we have exceptional retention. And what's also been interesting is we've had really good retention, not just within our team, but even the partners that we work with, like the manufacturer, our primary manufacturer That we've worked with in China. We do some domestic manufacturing, we do some in China. Their entire team is the same team we've worked with for seven or eight years. Wow. Many of our partners. And so that is hard to overstate the power of continuity in building a great team. So anyway, so I think that's a very long-winded way of answering the question I guess.

- The Nine to Five Idea Is Resonating With Gen Z
  Key takeaways:
  - Every generation has a different frame of reference and experiences the world differently
  - It is important to empathize and intellectually understand the perspectives of younger generations
  - Trying to judge whether a perspective is good or bad is not helpful
  - Younger generations fundamentally want the same things as older generations, but their expressions and pursuits can be different
  - Working a nine to five job can be challenging
  Transcript:
  Speaker 3
  Of studies and thoughts out there. There's the Twitter thing that went around recently that got both supported and blasted about the nine to five idea like how do I have a life and work in nine to five in today's environment Because it's not really like five anymore. So, yeah, as you look at the younger generation and bringing them into this culture, do you find that, I mean, maybe I'm leaning the witness a little bit, but you find this is resonating With Gen Z? Philip R.D. Well, it's just different.
  Speaker 1
  And I think that everyone has to understand that every generation after you has a very different frame that they've experienced the world through and that we can empathize and that We can intellectually understand, we'll never fully emotionally understand, but we can intellectually at least try to understand the way that they've experienced the world. And usually it's my opinion is it's not helpful to try and kind of cast judgment one way or the other of is this a good perspective or bad perspective, but this is like, this is the way that They're viewing the world that fundamentally they want the same things that I want, but the expression of that and how they pursue them can look really different. The video that you're talking about, for example, I actually posted something where more or less I said, like people are kind of tearing this person down, but it's like, listen, it is Hard to work a nine to five job. It is hard the first time you come out of ([Time 0:31:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1f0e8a72-9929-4ade-8756-796b39071efa))

  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Talked about between the world that is and the world that can't be. And they care intensely about that gap. And now I think some of the times their ideas about how to bridge that gap may be a little bit misguided. Like we've all had that. Like periods where we thought, oh, I know better. You know, if I was in charge, I could fix things. Me and my 20s, man. But yeah, exactly. We've all had that phase where kind of in the arrogance of youth, we think that we've got it all figured out. But you can't do anything really but applaud that they care that deeply about saying, hey, I do want to impact the world and the world can be better. It should be better. An example of how this line of thinking can be difficult. So I'm the entrepreneur in residence at the University of Oklahoma. And I talked to a lot of students that have startup ideas. Like I work with groups that are startup ideas. And to that kind of audience, what I do is exceptionally attractive, the focus on generosity and having cause being a real part of a focus of a for-profit company. And when they come up with business ideas, often they'll come up with ideas that are like, okay, we're going to do this thing, but we're going to give money to, you know, dogs, finding Dogs homes, you know, abandoned dogs, you know, we're going to help find them homes. So we're going to give money towards homelessness or whatever. The problem is often they will ([Time 0:33:04](https://share.snipd.com/snip/bfa81771-3ccc-4c17-881c-f88d509e72e4))

- How to Impact Culture at Your Company
  Key takeaways:
  - The speaker suggests that even in a large company with a different culture, individuals can still make a positive impact.
  - Building something meaningful and showcasing positive change can attract others to join a team and drive performance.
  - The approach to addressing cultural challenges may vary depending on the generation.
  - There is no exclusive right way to tackle these challenges.
  - The speaker questions why there is a growing favorability towards communism among a significant portion of the younger population in the country.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  For you? And sometimes it's like, well, I'm in a 30,000 person company and my company's culture is not this. And so I wish it was, but it's not that. And then the question is, okay, but are you on a department or are you on a team? What's the subculture you're a part of? What are the microways that you impact culture at that company or would you have the ability to apply some of these ideas and build something meaningful? And when you do that, that creates change and people see that and they see that as attractive and people want to join your team and it drives out performance and all that stuff. So depending on the generation, I think the way that you want to press on this idea looks a little bit different because the stumbling blocks are a little bit different. And nobody has, I think, a monopoly on the right way to approach it. I think part of the reason why you have a, I mean, it's worth asking the question, why do you have a generation that looks at capitalism, for example, and you have such a high percentage Of the population that thinks communism is not bad. Maybe communism would be better. Like if you look at a lot of the polling of people, you'd see the favorability towards communism, especially in people under 30 in this country is probably the highest it's been in the Long time. Why is that to some extent, I think that that's the falling down of capitalism ([Time 0:36:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/b023e192-de54-4e15-9756-d859f214231a))
- The Importance of Purpose in Life
  Key takeaways:
  - Business has the power to create good and change the world
  - Creating value in people's lives earns the right to have ideas about changing the world
  - Cincomodern is focused on building a culture with meaningful impact

  - High sense of purpose is more important than financial gain
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  Hey, the amazing power for good that business can create. And then at the same time, like you've got people that are just coming in that have all these ideas about how to change the world. They've got to be coached into like where you earn that right is by creating value in the lives of people.
  Speaker 3
  So anyway, those are those are the drums I'd be men. That is incredible, Mike. I love what you had to say. If the world does look different in 2024, it's through teams like the one at Cincomodern that are focused on building a culture that actually has meaning involved. At some level, when you go to your job, you actually care about what you do and you feel like you're making an impact and you like the people you work with. Does it just get me better than that?
  Speaker 1
  It hasn't for me. And I say this often, our company obviously is very profitable at this scale. And I'm not the only owner, but I'm the biggest owner. I've never considered the sale and the financial piece of it is not motivating, especially at this point. I mean, there is a point where your bank account where it's like, it's just zeros functioning. I'm not going to live my life any differently based on what the company does and I'll get asked, okay, so why not? Why not sell the company? Why not do something different? And the answer is that why would I trade a high sense of purpose and that my days are ([Time 0:37:27](https://share.snipd.com/snip/45240f26-61fc-4de1-a752-03e96b33d63c))
- The Rarity of Gold
  Key takeaways:
  - Trusting someone with a significant part of their life is important in attracting and retaining employees
  - Gold's value is not solely based on its rarity or functional purpose, but rather its difficulty to obtain
  - Gold has been highly valued throughout history due to its scarcity
  - The difficulty in acquiring gold is what has made it valuable
  Transcript:
  Speaker 1
  The fact that I want them to? Why should somebody want to come and work with me?
  Speaker 3
  And want to join? It's trusting a good chunk of their life to you. Absolutely.
  Speaker 1
  So I'll give an analogy there. There's this interesting idea of like, why is gold valuable?
  Speaker 3
  Guess why is gold valuable? What would you say? It's rare. It's something that's tangible. The resale market's always there. Like, you know, there's a lot of reasons why gold's valuable.
  Speaker 1
  I'm curious where you're about to go. Yeah, exactly. Because it's like, when you ask a question, it's like, well, I know that gold's valuable. But I'm not exactly sure why gold is valuable. And it's like, the rarity has something to do with it. But even still, it's like, well, we still don't do anything except make go jewelry with it. Like, we don't, gold doesn't have a functional purpose. So why does it matter if it's rare? There's a lot of things that don't have a functional purpose that are rare that we don't care about. Right. Gold. Especially why has gold historically been such a valuable thing? If you look over the last couple of centuries, at least, this was a night centuries, like, you know, millennia. Like, if you look back to biblical times, like gold's a big deal going into ancient civilizations, why? So the most compelling answer that I think I've heard is because it is so hard to get. That's what made has made gold valuable. And here's what I mean by that. If you were a king that wanted gold, well, what do you need? Well, you ([Time 0:41:26](https://share.snipd.com/snip/144c0ae3-13f6-4433-9af9-d1fb39402b11))

  - Gold's value has been significant in ancient civilizations and is seen as a symbol of power and wealth.

That's what made has made gold valuable. And here's what I mean by that. If you were a king that wanted gold, well, what do you need? Well, you need lands that have mines on them. Okay. And then you need people who are willing to go into those mines and are able to extract the gold. Industry that's able to kind of refine and, you know, smelt and do things with that gold. And then you need to be able to defend that gold so that somebody doesn't come and take it. So you need to be able to have armies. And that gold is like, to use a cryptocurrency idea, gold is like proof of work.
