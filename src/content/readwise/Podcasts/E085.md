- **Remnant Sports Ads**
  - For cost-effective TV advertising, buy remnant ad space during extra innings or overtime in sports.
  - This strategy capitalizes on increased viewership during these periods without needing specific placement times.
  Transcript:
  Sean Ellis
  Totally. I want to go back to TV because the real alpha on, sorry, TV and sports is if you work with Atari or anybody else, just try to buy extra innings, okay? Like overtime, we don't need our ads to run any particular time. If you're a movie that comes out on Friday, you need to run during the Thursday game or the Friday game or the Saturday game, like out now. We don't really need that. We don't care if it runs Friday or Tuesday. It doesn't really matter. Right. So you're optimizing for the cheapest cost per view, right. Or even cost per visitor, whatever. To get that done, tell them I will buy any extra innings, like overtime and NBA. Like we bought World Series a couple of years ago and that's how we did it. It's like, Hey, look, when it goes to inning 10, give me all the ads. Because more people are actually watching the later it goes. Even people leave the stadium. So how does that work?
  Katie
  Because you have to book it in advance and then to get clearance, right? It's not live. We're meta. If we have a good day, we can scale that day. I mean, Tatari is a lot more like you have to have clearance or you have to clear.
  Matt
  You're giving them – they clear the creative per network or per like group of networks. And then you're sort of like at that point, Tartari is literally buying that inventory like remnant inventory. Right. So it's not because there's no guarantee there's extra innings. So they treat that like remnant.
  Katie
  Can they go in and scale the one like though, like he's saying What if some game goes into overtime? Can you increase the spend? Yeah, no. It has to be pre-bought. ([Time 0:48:07](https://share.snipd.com/snip/66970ec4-ee00-4b89-b641-4d9f0e73bb95))
- **Q5 Testing**
  - Test Tatari during Q5 (Christmas week to the second week of January) when prices are lower.
  - Big brands pull back ad spend, making it a good entry point for smaller companies.
  Transcript:
  Katie
  A good point. So are they pushing you? So they keep talking about Q5 and like what we're going to do, which usually we pull way back to after shipping cut off. But I would think for brands that are wanting to like test out Tatari, it'd be a great time to kind of test to see. I mean, it's just cheap. Like that's when it's the cheapest to buy TV, when all the big brands have pulled out. I mean, you know.
  Sean Ellis
  Well, I'll also say that I bet viewership's actually really, really high from Christmas what do you do after thanksgiving you sit and watch tv yeah totally right after christmas yeah
  Katie
  Yeah so i maybe we shouldn't tell people that and we just run it and see um so ([Time 0:51:06](https://share.snipd.com/snip/f6e79418-903c-4598-9dc5-6cf9c962adc7))
- **Q5 Sales and Engagement**
  - Embrace the Q5 period (Christmas to mid-January) for strong sales, especially for gifting products.
  - Revenue can remain significant even after Christmas, although engagement peaks on Christmas Day.
  Transcript:
  Sean Ellis
  That's something we really embraced last year is like you know this this idea of q5 from like you know, basically the week of Christmas until the second week of January and just going Hard as hell. And I'll, I'll pull up live sales results of that week. And I think it's really strong. We also really pull back, you know, shipping cutoff and like the last day of shipping cutoff, we probably do $2 million or whatever.
  Katie
  Like it's a, it's a huge revenue driver for us because we're a gift giving product yeah and then so you just each day you add on another day as long as you can keep up i think i remember last Year at christmas you being because our cutoff was before yours and every day sean's like i'm extending my cutoff and i just did another 20 million dollars yeah i'm like yeah yeah look
  Sean Ellis
  We we also don't run our warehouse. So we're dependent on somebody else. But dude, so the drop off Christmas Eve, we're lucky to break a couple hundred thousand bucks. Three days before Christmas Eve, four days before Christmas Eve, it's a multimillion dollar day. So it's like- God. You run that close to Christmas? Yeah.
  Katie
  What are you doing? Like overnight shipping?
  Sean Ellis
  Well, we drive a lot of people to Amazon. Like, so we'll do a million dollars like the last day amazon can guarantee which is like the 22nd or 23rd um but then this q5 idea it's fine i mean like the day after christmas we're probably Up to four hundred thousand dollars from like 150 on christmas itself so we can scale up a little bit, but we'll try harder this year.
  Matt
  Yeah. Christmas day is pretty good. I don't get it. Yeah, it is for us too.
  Sean Ellis
  I love it.
  Katie
  Christmas day, the day after, and then we skyrocket. I love January. It's ([Time 0:51:47](https://share.snipd.com/snip/55967de1-d4a0-4850-918e-953a61ac3dc0))
