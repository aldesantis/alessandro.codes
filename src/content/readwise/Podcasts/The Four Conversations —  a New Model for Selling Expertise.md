  - The probative conversation, where you prove your expertise, is distinct from the other three.

  You. Yeah. So, four conversations, three of them are quite similar to each other, and the first one is quite different from the other three. So the first conversation, the probative conversation where your objective is to prove your expertise to the client and move in their mind from a position of a vendor, ([Time 0:11:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/93b57cf9-b566-471a-97e8-d5b188697f88))
- - The Four Conversations model for selling expertise includes: probative, qualifying, value, and closing conversations.
  - The probative conversation happens *without* you present; it's built through reputation and referrals, setting the stage for how the first in-person conversation will begin.

  You. Yeah. So, four conversations, three of them are quite similar to each other, and the first one is quite different from the other three. So the first conversation, the probative conversation where your objective is to prove your expertise to the client and move in their mind from a position of a vendor, a needy vendor To the expert. And we can unpack that. We have in a previous episode, but that's the probative conversation. The key to the probative conversation and why it's so different from the other three conversations is the probative conversation happens without you present. It's really a function of your reputation preceding you and how you build that reputation through word of mouth or thought leadership or those who refer you.

And we can unpack that. We have in a previous episode, but that's the probative conversation. The key to the probative conversation and why it's so different from the other three conversations is the probative conversation happens without you present. It's really a function of your reputation preceding you and how you build that reputation through word of mouth or thought leadership or those who refer you. The probative conversation sets the stage for how the first human-to conversation is going to happen or at least begin. The first human-to conversation is the qualifying conversation. That's where you vet the lead to see if there's an opportunity here and then determine the next step. You might think of that as kind of a prototypical sales conversation. It's the first interaction where both parties are vetting each other. Now, typically, most salespeople feel like they are being vetted and they are letting the client vet them. But we offer a framework for vetting the client. This is more than just a framework. The third conversation is the value conversation. So once they're vetted and you determine there is indeed an opportunity here worth spending time on, you now move to the value to be created. So the objective is to determine the value to be created and then to determine the share of that value you might command in the form of fees or compensation. Then the fourth conversation ([Time 0:11:50](https://share.snipd.com/snip/87be76e3-6c2c-4fe7-a6ce-5239bf59c96c))

- - The probative conversation happens *without* you present, through marketing and reputation-building.
  - If a lead sees you as just another vendor, your probative conversation hasn't happened effectively.

  Let's say that a firm hasn't done any of their own marketing, so they're kind of starting from scratch.

  Might that probative conversation actually be a conversation? No. So it's a good question, and I think it's the one place in the model where people are most likely to get tripped up, and that's all on the author. The probative conversation either happens or it doesn't. Skip ahead to the second conversation, the first person to person conversation, a qualifying conversation, an opportunity comes in, a lead comes in. Somebody says, hey, I want to talk to you about engaging you. You get on the phone or Zoom with them and you have a conversation. And it's pretty clear that they're talking to three others. They don't see you as meaningfully different. You're a name on a list. They Googled X service provider, Y geography, and you came up 14th and you're just a name on the list. So from that first moment of the sale and the first person-to interaction, you are in the vendor position. The goal of the probative conversation, ([Time 0:14:03](https://share.snipd.com/snip/0626253c-ece7-4823-abbd-f571d46fc158))
