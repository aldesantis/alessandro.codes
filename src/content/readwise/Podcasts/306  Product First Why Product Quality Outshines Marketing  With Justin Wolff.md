## Highlights
- **Yoobi's Impact**
  - Justin Wolff co-founded Yoobi, a give-one-get-one school supply company.
  - This experience exposed him to the beauty industry's lack of regulation and plastic overuse, inspiring Junk Theory.

  This product and this packaging come from?
  Justin Wolff
  Yeah. So in 2014, I co-founded another impact brand called Ubi. It was a school supply company built on the idea or concept of one-for giving. So for every item we sold, we donated a school supply item to Kids in Need in the U.S. That business grew really quickly, was picked up by Target. And by our second year, we were giving more than a million kids a year free sets of school supplies all in the U.S. My co-founders of that brand had built out a, later on, a few years later, a beauty incubator where they had a lot of relationships with celebrities, a lot of relationships with retailers And throughout the supply chain. So everything was kind of done under the same roof. And that's where I got my real first peek behind the proverbial curtain to see and learn how that beauty sausage was made. And what I very quickly realized was that it was an industry with very little regulation, almost no transparency, and it was just drowning in plastic. And so as someone who's really enjoyed building brands that have impact that go beyond the financial bottom lines, the idea was, hey, wait a second here. There's this meteoric rise in, let's call it clean beauty. Almost no one can really define what that means. And at the same time, the conversation seems to end around formula. Whereas I had the sense that it should really begin there. If we're going to talk about clean beauty as a category, of course, the formula should be good for people and planet. But then maybe it's worth us asking, given the single use nature of all the products in this category, shouldn't we start thinking about what those formulas come packaged in? And that was the genesis of the idea behind what would ultimately ([Time 0:01:52](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ec4edafd-ae3e-44e9-9188-c2480eb7a3e2))
- **Packaging Material Selection**
  - Ocean-waste plastic is often too degraded for effective reuse in skincare packaging.
  - Aluminum is the most recycled material and doesn't require consumers to deviate from their usual recycling habits.
  Transcript:
  Chase Clymer
  Absolutely. And what was the material that you settled on for the packaging?
  Justin Wolff
  Yeah. So I'll take you back a little bit. And really, one of the first things that we did, my co-founder and I with Jump Theory is we actually took a trip out to Jakarta to go and film and document and record the legacy of our secretly Used plastic and the amount of waste that was out there. And we found ourselves walking on literally floating islands of plastic off of the coast of Jakarta. That was the kind of thing where once you see it, you can't unsee it. And that sent us down a path of, okay, well, if we're going to try and do something that's not incrementally better, but really something that's impossible to ignore, we really needed To start with, you know, material analysis. What could we package these things in? Right. Because there's a lot of choices out there. Right. And we actually first started with ocean waste plastic. We thought, hey, let's pull plastic out of the ocean and, you know, repurpose it into into jars. And then when people are done with it, they can either send it back to us or we'll upcycle it but what we very quickly realized is that you know ocean waste plastic is just too degraded to Actually effectively use in skincare packaging um there's a lot of what's called green washing out there about uh you know what kind of materials can be used and not there's a difference Between ocean waste plastic and ocean bound plastic. Anyway, the key thing that kept us from going down the ocean waste plastic route beyond just how, you know, ineffective the material was as a packaging solution was the fact that less Than 5% of plastic gets recycled in the US. So we were thinking, okay, it's great that we could do this. Maybe we can pull it out of the ocean, make packaging. But at the end of the day, when people are done with our products in two months, it's going to end up right back where it started. So that moved us away from there. Then we started looking at a whole range of biopolymers and materials, you know, sugar cane and, you know, wood polymers and all kinds of things like that. However, the challenge that we have with that is that they, as compostable as they would like to call themselves out, as they really need to be industrially composted to be effectively Composted. And the infrastructure is just not there in the U.S. So that led us down to some, you know, sort of old thinking on, hey, how was stuff packaged before plastic was ubiquitous around the world? Metal was a real solution back then, metal and glass. And then we began to analyze the sort of recyclability of both, the carbon footprint of both. And long story short is that we ended up with metal, aluminum, the most recycled and recyclable material on earth. It's lightweight. And we didn't want the consumer to have to do any kind of heavy lifting. As soon as you ask the consumer to start going outside of their normal behavioral patterns, the efficacy of your impact program could be severely impacted. So any sort of, hey, ship this back to us. OK, we're adding carbon footprint. Hey, take this into a store. What are the odds of someone actually doing that? So we just said, hey, how do we meet the consumer where they're at and create something that they can just responsibly, you know, recycle curbside? With them, you just pop them in the recycling bin and they will get recycled. So ultimately, we felt like metal or aluminum was the material to really change the game and weight the industry up in terms of its sustainability problem.

- **Product Quality First**
  - Prioritize product quality over marketing hype.
  - Invest in developing original formulas and avoid white-labeling, which is common in the beauty industry.

  And so you've got the story and the green power behind this recyclable packaging. But some might argue the more important part of the brand, the makeup itself, the skincare itself. So walk me through that and how that all played out.
  Justin Wolff
  Yeah, that's a great question. Look, at the end of the day, people are buying formula, not packaging, right? It's not like we go in a store and, hey, I need my moisturizer and I'm thinking only about packaging. So you're absolutely right. I think that was one of the most important lessons that I learned actually in my time at UB, where I was a chief giving officer over there. So my job was basically to build out and communicate the impact side of that brand. And I always wanted to put impact first and put that messaging there about how much we're giving away and how important it is that everyone has access to basic school supplies. But I think the most important lesson that I learned during my time at UB was that if your product, the product itself does not win and it's not better than what sits to the left or the right Of it on the shelf, whether that's digital or in the real world, then you don't create any impact. So we took that philosophy into junk theory. And, you know, for example, we just did not do any shortcuts when it comes to formulas. One of the biggest investments that we made at the beginning of the company was to actually go ahead and develop these formulas from the ground up with one of the best green chemists out There. A dirty little secret in the beauty industry, you're going to see brands popping up every two seconds. You will almost never see a brand that builds formula from scratch. Essentially, what they do is what's called white labeling, which is essentially a formula that will have some standard stock formulas out there. You maybe sprinkle a couple of new ingredients in it and you call it yours. We didn't do that. And we built these things from scratch. Our formulas across the board have been winning awards across the category since we started. And I actually think that's been one of the best drivers of sales and brand loyalty is the fact that our formulas are so good, so effective, and they actually do what they say they're going To do.
