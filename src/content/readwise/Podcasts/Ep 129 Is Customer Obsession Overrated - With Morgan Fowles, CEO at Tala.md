  Transcript:
  Morgan Fowles
  I'm really lucky because we have such an engaged, large user base at this point that there's almost like no large room that I go into where I don't have some diehard fans in the room. I was at the London mayor's office has like a CEO scale up conference that they do every year. So I was there last week, you know, and I'm sitting there with like tech CEOs and AI founders, you know, who are building unicorn businesses. And I'm doing my usual humbling, like I make leggings spiel, you know, which as I say, is always a very humbling experience in those kinds of rooms. And yet by the end of each session, I had several women and men coming up to me to say, we love what you're doing. ([Time 0:07:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/8fed6da3-aa16-464d-9476-fd68099fca40))

  They are Tala. I suppose I'm curious, first off, why do you think this is? Why do you think that is? Is that something that's part of the hiring process or is it just kind of happened organically?
  Morgan Fowles
  Yeah, it's definitely one of our unfair advantages. I think part of it is that just, you know, and I've worked for a number of different fashion companies now across London and the US, there are just a lot of these offices are filled with Women age 20 to 30 who are career oriented and love fashion. And so we have this like great, well-qualified, available talent base. And then couple that with the fact that Tala generates so much love and engagement from its customers that we have an opportunity to create this sort of cross intersection of people Who are very, very passionate, well-qualified customers, and also within our demographic. It's not 100% aligned, even probably since you and I sat on that panel together. We now have a handful of men working in the office who also add a tremendous amount of value every day. But certainly, I have a statistically significant sample size. ([Time 0:09:01](https://share.snipd.com/snip/9e59c547-593d-46e8-b721-f5651570079d))
- **Early Customer Focus**
  - Customer obsession should be a core brand value from the start. 
  - Understanding your customer is crucial for achieving product-market fit.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  Want to extend the customer obsession sort of point you're talking about there, which is kind of the bulk of this conversation. But I'm curious, like, do you think it should be a pillar of a brand from their kind of inception? Or I suppose, is there a risk in that? Or should it be something that really gets sort of explored in a much richer way once you've found product market fit? How do you think about that?
  Morgan Fowles
  Yeah, I mean, I think, I mean, look, the customer is the market and product market fit, right? So it's kind of a bit of a chicken in the egg. I don't know how you can find product market fit, which would require strong alignment with your customer without knowing who they are. ([Time 0:11:22](https://share.snipd.com/snip/713f7eb9-d424-4f90-ab08-1e881ef9c98f))
- **Customer Involvement in Product Development**
  - Involve customers deeply in product development, including fit checks and feedback sessions. 
  - Show appreciation for their time and input through incentives and thoughtful experiences.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  I must admit, I think it's, it's really powerful. Feels quiet, feels powerful. Getting back to something you said before, I'm curious how involved brands should get their customers in product development. You mentioned that sometimes you have customers come in and doing the fit checks and it sounds like they are intimately involved in the product. How does that play out? And do you think there's any risks with that?
  Morgan Fowles
  I mean, there are risks with anything. The thing that I always worry about, because honestly, I think you can't do it too much. And I almost think there's no side of that experience that would be negative for us, regardless of what we do, we're going to learn in those interactions. Because any time spent with customers, any time getting their opinion on products or messaging and so on is completely invaluable. The only risk is that, you know, as I alluded to before, we are fast paced. We've got a lot going on. I would have customers in every single day if I could, but I'm also conscious that we need to make the experience worthwhile for them. And that if you don't make the experience worthwhile, you could be delivering, you know, what is quite a negative experience for somebody who was probably one of your more engaged customers Before that. And we've never had anything like that happen. But I think fear of that happening is probably what stops us from doing it even more often. So, you know, you just want the basics, like appreciating that we're kind of going about our day in our office and they're coming in like you might expect a supplier or what have you, but You need to make sure that they're properly greeted. You need to make sure that they know where to find the restroom, that there's refreshments for them, that they have a comfortable place to sit, that they're going to have somebody to Talk to while they're waiting, that you're thoughtful about how you're using their data and you're really clear with them about the privacy around all of it. And then, you know, generally, most people just want to come in to share their ideas, but we also always try to offer some sort of incentive with like gifting and so on as a thank you afterwards. But, you know, I think that's really the biggest risk is like, these are people who are so engaged with you, who love your brand. You just want to make sure that what you're doing is offering them an extension of the brand experience and you want to make sure that it still lives up to their expectations.

- **The Ebb and Flow of Cool**
  - Fashion brands often lose their "cool" factor and struggle to regain it. 
  - Creating different brands for different age demographics can be a smart diversification strategy.

  Speaker 2
  I'm curious to sort of look at a bit of a case study. And I thought Nike's been in the news recently. And I think one of the challenges they've had is they've lost a lot of their younger audience. And I'm wondering, what do you think brands can do to navigate it? And I'm always intrigued by the kind of H&M model where they've got these, whatever it is, 10 to 15 year segments. And they build different brands for those different generations and kind of like follow them. Do you think that's an interesting model or do you think it's better to just stay with your cohort and move with them as they get older or their lives change? Yeah.
  Morgan Fowles
  So there are a few different components to this. I mean, I would say just generally sort of on the turnaround point, I think it was Warren Buffett who said, turn around, seldom turn around. And for many, many years in this industry, that has felt so true to me that, you know, once a brand was dead, it was dead. But lately, there have been some really exciting turnarounds. And I think the pattern is that when there's some sort of disruptive channel that comes onto the market, so whether that was meta ads in the 2010s or then influencer in the 20-teens, the Incoming fashion companies really were able to take market share away from the dinosaurs, which couldn't catch up. And then when you have lulls in those kinds of new channel developments, you get kind of the dinosaurs catching up again. AI could be an interesting disruptor in this way. But in the meantime, we are starting to see some more legacy companies do some really cool things. So I wouldn't count Nike out. I also, I think it depends a little bit just on the age point specifically. I mean, I think if you've got a very high profile founder like we do, naturally you're going to have the customer base aging with the founder. You know, especially if you've got one who's going through kind of noticeable life changes like our founder is. This might be less true of older founders. But yeah, I mean, H&M is an interesting one. I think they've been very clever, certainly in a lot of ways over the last few years. And they're definitely having a moment right now. But they have been very clever amongst other things with how they have these sort of brands positioned at different ages. I don't know that a customer who shops weekday goes on to shop cause. I don't know that it's quite that linear because often brands that have an age focus also have like a design and style aesthetic that might speak to one, you know, aesthetically weekday And cause are very different brands. But certainly from like a diversification standpoint, from a risk standpoint, it's very smart that they have brands that hit these different age demographics. But I think probably in general, brands tend to play within one age demographic and stay there more than they age up. I think it's really what happens in fashion is that brands stop being cool at a point. Like it just is inevitable. Even some of the coolest brands in the world, which I won't say now because I don't want to be mean, were at one point like really cool and then just aren't. And in some ways like that is what's fun about fashion and that's what keeps it fresh. And that is why there's always an opportunity for new entrants.

- **Engaging with Creators**
  - Leverage PR gifting and user-generated content (UGC) to engage with creators. 
  - Meet creators where they are and amplify their content to build mutually beneficial relationships.
  Transcript:
  Speaker 2
  We kind of draw to the end of the conversation, I'm really interested in that interplay between like customer and creator. And Tala is a really interesting brand when you think about that interplay, right? I think sort of speaking about grace and that element of it, I feel we can leave that to the side. I'm curious though, like my sense is that a brand like Tala has this kind of interesting relationship with their customers where there's probably like creators in the waiting. You know what I mean? Like they are a new breed of creator that are coming up. They might be working for Tala. I don't know, you know, probably. And I'm curious how you, do you guys think about it like that? Do you think about, okay, we've got this customer base, the customer base, they're super engaged. They're also, as you say, social first, hyper digitally native. They are going to be potentially the next big whatever. How do we work with them? Or am I going too deep on that? Is that like too granular?
  Morgan Fowles
  We're not really in the business of trying to create new creators or to try to make new talent. There's certainly, I think, the ones that are great, that will happen for them. The way that we engage with it is really kind of specifically through two channels. So one would be PR gifting. And this is something that a lot of brands can do when they're smaller, if they want to engage with content creators and influencers who they may not be able to afford, but who are brand Loyalists, you can gift and see if they will organically post off the back of that. There's still some tagging that one needs to do just to be sure you're on the right side of the ASA on that sort of stuff. But that can be a good way, you know, with people who are authentically really love your products. And we get a lot of that. And then the other thing is just UGC. So our customers, you know, it's sort of hard, I think, what the definition of a creator is in this day and age. And some people are creators through some channels and not through others. You know, I'm private through my most of my social profiles, but I'm public on LinkedIn, for example. And some people are comfortable being kind of creators in some contexts and not in others. And you just, ultimately, you have to meet people where they are and engage on those platforms. And yes, absolutely, a lot of our customers create their own content. We love putting that content through our own channels and creating a bigger platform for them. And they love when we do it. So it's really a win-win and we do it all day, every day.

- **Customer Obsession is Key**
  - Customer obsession is crucial for success. 
  - Focus on solving customer problems, understanding their values, and building deep connections.

  Speaker 2
  Right. I'm going to draw the conversation to a close here. I'm going to pose the final question. I probably know the answer to it, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Do you think customer recession is overrated?
  Morgan Fowles
  No.
  Speaker 2
  Thought that might be the case. Tell me more.
  Morgan Fowles
  No, I think it's impossible for it to be overrated. Maybe this is a slightly sort of American, the customer is always right philosophy. And I think it's important to use it in certain contexts to know who you're talking to, whether they've been a customer of yours for many years or they've made one purchase. It's also important to bear in mind that we're working, for example, 12 months ahead of them on the production cycle. So there are certain trends that are emerging that we have line of sight to that the customer may not yet have line of sight to. And we have professionals who are trained in doing that work and access to other kinds of data platforms and things. You know, it sort of goes back to the, you know, faster horses quote that everybody uses, right? You have to inject some of your own professionalism and tools over the process. But ultimately, as I was saying, if you treat it not as a tick box exercise, but if you really develop your product to solve your customers' problems and to delight them and to bring them Exactly what they're looking for, then you have to be close to them, not just what they want from you, but where they are and what they need, what their underlying values are so that you're Building a pipeline, a set of products, and really a value set in a way of communicating that resonates very, very deeply with them. And if you do that, then you will be connecting with them and it's almost impossible not to be successful. I ([Time 0:29:36](https://share.snipd.com/snip/a07b1cdb-1ca9-4873-a885-264d9280b17e))
