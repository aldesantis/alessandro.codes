## Highlights
- Modern aspiration economy is anchored not in accumulation and display of possessions or even experiences, but of social capital, environmental credits, and cultural savviness (Currid-Halkett, 2017; Eckhardt, 2020). ([Location 125](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=125))
- Desirability of something is today decoupled from its price, and its access is decoupled from wealth. Instead, it’s coupled with social capital, environmental creds, cultural savviness, a story, belonging, and its transformative potential to make us better humans.

- There are two ways to hack culture. First is to root a brand in a subculture or a niche. Second is capturing the zeitgeist, or kuuki wo yomu, a Japanese word used to depict reading the atmosphere. ([Location 246](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=246))
- Our job is to make the secondary effects of our choices – what our individual actions do to our communal ties and our environment – visible. Making these further-out effects visible will force us to take them into account. ([Location 263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=263))
- Glossier succeeded because it recognized that women enjoy sharing their beauty preferences, it and gave them the tools to create content that enabled conversations around it. Glossier’s value is not in the sheer scale of its user base, but rather in the interactions within it. ([Location 346](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=346))
- The main lesson is that wide awareness doesn’t mean conversion and that seeing the fast user growth doesn’t mean profitability. To hack growth, startups have to “hack” culture first. ([Location 356](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=356))
- The dynamics of how trends are created and how they spread shifted from brands, media, and retailers pushing ideas to mass market, to the Internet networks of niches and taste communities. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=357))
- As sociologist Duncan Watts notes in his research on social influence (2007), if a society is ready to embrace a trend, almost anyone can start one – and if it isn’t ready, then almost no one can. ([Location 372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=372))

- In the modern aspiration economy, taste is not given. It’s not a passive play of social differentiation. It’s an activity that is continuously developed, cultivated, and refined. ([Location 391](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=391))
- We are attention-seeking creatures, and when we go out, we “perform” for others, per sociologist Erving Goffman, and this performance gives “meaning to ourselves, to others, and to our situation.” ([Location 495](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=495))
- The future is hidden in our present: in what we value, who we gather around and pay attention to, what we support, and what we rally against. ([Location 523](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=523))

- Originally coined by futurist Paul Saffo (2012), contradictions, inversions, oddities, and coincidences are indicators that change is ahead. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=526))
- Consumers want choice, but in order to navigate it, they rely on others and so end up enjoying the same fashion trends, movies, diets, and songs. ([Location 538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=538))
- In the inversion of aspiration, influencers were caught in crosshairs. If they behaved like everyone else, they were everyone else; if they behaved differently, they were called out for it. ([Location 551](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=551))
    - Tags: [[influencers]] [[Marketing]] 
- Oddities are out-of-ordinary occurrences that make us search beneath the surface or a trend or pattern. ([Location 559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=559))
    - Tags: [[Marketing]] 
- Coincidences are about simultaneous appearance of distant and unrelated trends or patterns. ([Location 572](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=572))
    - Tags: [[Marketing]] [[culture]] 
- Make social currency an inherent part of your business plan. Social activity in a market accumulates social capital. ([Location 594](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=594))
    - Tags: [[purpose]] [[branding]] [[Marketing]] 
- Mega-influencers have reach, just like mass media. The best way for marketers to use them is for awareness, with cost per mille as the core metric, and to accept that they will not know which part of their budget is wasted. ([Location 762](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=762))
- Some of the biggest brands in the world that are viewed as tremendously successful by most of the usual metrics still struggle with community-building or maintaining a legitimate connection with their customers. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=771))
- Chinese super apps like Little Red Book and WeChat’s Good Product Circle have already turned Chinese collective review power into an integral part of their shopping experience. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=778))
    - Tags: [[retail]] [[social-shopping]] [[ecommerce]] [[social-proof]] 
- Social commerce emphasizes individual taste and style savviness over brands: we are buying someone’s look, not a particular brand within it. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=788))
    - Tags: [[retail]] [[culture]] [[social-media]] [[ecommerce]] 
- Marketing and promotional machinery will move toward product seeding across social shopping communities, monitoring the emerging best-sellers and amplifying the best performing product styling. This monitor-and-optimize, product-centric model is the opposite of brand-centric communication; it is also the opposite of the current influencer marketing model. ([Location 793](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=793))
    - Tags: [[influencers]] [[Marketing]] [[social-shopping]] 
- In the social commerce context, products make influencers, not the other way around. ([Location 795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=795))
- social commerce extends product life cycle nearly indefinitely, as the same product can be resold and prosperously revived in many different styling iterations. ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=806))
    - Tags: [[social-media]] [[retail]] [[Marketing]] 
- if people now cultivate their own personalities in order to sell products and build a community, brands need to figure out what it is that they are doing. ([Location 821](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=821))
- It is a fertile social context, and not any particular influencer or a celebrity, that starts a trend. ([Location 829](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=829))
- Modern aspiration is not about having money to buy things, but having the taste to know what to buy. ([Location 842](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=842))
- Tsundoku is a Japanese word for the uncomfortable feeling of having too many books to read. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=844))
- Knowing where to go and what to do is the currency that, in the modern aspiration economy, makes curators more important than influencers. ([Location 852](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=852))
- Curation gives even mundane objects value by connecting them with a point of view, heritage, a subculture, or purpose that makes them stand out in the vortex of speed, superficiality, and newness. ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=854))
- For a brand, curation can retain an audience and attract the new one that hasn’t considered a brand before. It can attract a collaborator or start a brand partnership. It can increase product value and protect pricing. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=864))
    - Tags: [[curation]] [[Marketing]] [[retail]] 
- Curation, by default, creates stories. Stories boost the relevance and significance of a product or a brand. ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=888))
- TikTok effectively wipes out social status as the influencer market’s capital and taste as its currency. It creates the radically new kind of market where we equal our own taste profiles. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=916))
- Think about your brand in plural. Just as my Netflix isn’t your Netflix, my pair of Off-White sneakers is not your pair of Off-White sneakers. ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1006))
- Today, we are going through the imagined community renaissance. Modern brands stepped in as the social constructs of belonging, and as the links between culture and psychology left vacant by traditional institutions of social cohesion. ([Location 1025](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1025))
- Second, a carefully cultivated online persona is today the social norm. Having an uncultivated one is a way of conveying social distinction. ([Location 1100](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1100))
    - Tags: [[culture]] 
- Both mechanisms, of social classification and social cohesion, also explain why, in the modern aspiration economy, brand affinity is created not economically, but socially – and why best loyalty programs treat their customers as community members. ([Location 1234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1234))
- The irony of most of today’s loyalty programs is that they aren’t about loyalty at all. They have more to do with economic calculation and gain management than with the true affinity for a brand. ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1237))
- True loyalty is emotional and irrational, and often at odds with our survival instinct. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1242))
- In the modern aspiration economy, consumers are fans, influencers, hobbyists, environmentalists, and collectors. Membership programs are designed for them. ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1250))
- The keyword here is not necessarily prestige and exclusivity, but identity and belonging. There’s a pure pleasure in the intimacy of consuming together, along with enjoying status within a community. ([Location 1263](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1263))
- Groups that activate a mentorship among their members offer a direct and clear value that makes the members stick and grows over time. ([Location 1290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1290))
- Originally coined by authors Zeynep Arsel and Jonathan Bean (2012), a taste regime defines how consumers create routines and meaning around objects. ([Location 1349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1349))
    - Tags: [[sociology]] [[retail]] 
- Trade in exchange value, not in use value. Use value is defined by a product’s functionality. Exchange value is defined by a product’s social appeal. ([Location 1395](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1395))
- Today’s VC time horizons do not allow for the next generation of Coke legends; instead, they churn Coke Lifes. ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1637))
- The key here is for brands to stop thinking about their community just as top-of-the-funnel tactic, and instead consider it as a long-term, bottom-of-the-funnel strategy (bonding, advocacy, loyalty). ([Location 1669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1669))
    - Tags: [[ecommerce]] [[Marketing]] [[community]] [[retail]] 
- Along with intangibles like access, experiences, and knowledge, the modern aspiration economy also created a cultural class unto its own. ([Location 1978](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=1978))
- All brands have to add responsibility, generosity, and social improvement to both their products and their actions. ([Location 2031](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08MVCGV1K&location=2031))
