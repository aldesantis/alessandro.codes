## Highlights
- Leadership is about recognizing that there's a greatness in everyone, and your job is to create an environment where that greatness can emerge. ([Location 679](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=679))
- while moving to truly empowered teams does require moving away from the old command‐and‐control model of management, it does not mean you need fewer leaders and managers. It means you need better leaders and managers. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=724))
- In contrast, in strong product companies, teams are instead given problems to solve, rather than features to build, and most important, they are empowered to solve those problems in the best way they see fit. And they are then held accountable to the results. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=754))
- In the empowered product team model, the product manager has a clear responsibility, which is to ensure that the solutions are valuable (our customers will buy the product and/or choose to use it), and viable (it will meet the needs of the business). Together with a product designer who is responsible for ensuring the solution is usable, and a tech lead who is responsible for ensuring the solution is feasible, the team is able to collaborate to address this full range of risks (value, viability, usability, and feasibility).

- Overall, we look to leadership for inspiration and we look to management for execution. ([Location 909](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=909))

- The product vision describes the future we are trying to create and, most important, how it improves the lives of our customers. It is usually between 3 and 10 years out. The product vision serves as the shared goal for the product organization. ([Location 920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=920))
    - Tags: [[product-management]] 
- The product strategy describes how we plan to accomplish the product vision, while meeting the needs of the business as we go. The strategy derives from focus, then leverages insights, converts these insights into action, and finally manages the work through to completion. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=938))

- If we want teams of missionaries, it's essential that every person in the organization understands and is convinced—they need to be true believers. ([Location 946](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=946))

- Whereas mentors dole out words of wisdom, coaches roll up their sleeves and get their hands dirty. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1127))
    - Tags: [[coaching]] 
- As a coach, you are always looking for opportunities that encourage your people to stretch beyond their comfort zone. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1188))

- I typically recommend at least 15 customer visits as part of new PM onboarding. ([Location 1394](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1394))
- I like to ask the PM to evaluate the top three to five players in the space and to write up a narrative comparing and contrasting the strengths and weaknesses of each player—highlighting opportunities. ([Location 1435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1435))
- the new PM must understand the four different types of product risk (value, usability, feasibility, and viability), the different forms of prototypes to tackle these risks, and how to test those risks qualitatively and quantitatively. ([Location 1494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1494))

- Great product marketing requires understanding the market first. It pressure‐tests assumptions based on what the market tells you so you can adapt, position, and market into customers' true reality. It makes clear why your product matters and should be loved using customers' language, experience, and needs. ([Location 1642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1642))

- Normally, the product vision is somewhere between 3 years and 10 years out and describes the future we are trying to create, and why that future will improve the lives of our customers. ([Location 1959](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1959))
    - Tags: [[product-management]] 
- The product principles complement the product vision by stating the values and beliefs that are intended to inform the many product decisions that will need to be made. ([Location 1967](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=1967))

- “There will always be many good reasons not to ship, and it's your responsibility to figure out a way over, around, or through each obstacle.” ([Location 2040](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2040))
- We need to find a solution that works. By that we mean that it is valuable (valuable enough that target customers will actually buy it or choose to use it), it is usable (so users can actually experience that value), it is feasible (so we can actually deliver that value), and it is viable for our business (so the rest of our company can effectively market, sell, and support the solution). ([Location 2236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2236))

- our job in product is to solve the problems we are asked to solve, in ways that our customers love, yet that work for our business. ([Location 2243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2243))

- It is my mind warning me of the consequences if I don't do my homework and truly prepare. The fear of looking clueless is what keeps me up late preparing, studying, thinking, writing, rehearsing, and iterating. ([Location 2372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2372))

- Whenever I see some product person deliver an underwhelming presentation to an executive team or a conference, my frustration is centered not on the product person, but rather on that person's manager. ([Location 2383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2383))
    - Tags: [[product-management]] 
- I also recommend a minimum of three, one‐hour customer interactions each week, ongoing, ([Location 2438](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2438))
    - Tags: [[product-management]] 
- Finally, while I need to make certain the product person genuinely likes and respects her customers, I don't want her to think her job is to ask her customers what to build. ([Location 2451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2451))

- “If a product team succeeds, it's because everyone on the team did what they needed to do, but if a product team fails, it's the product manager.” ([Location 2547](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2547))
    - Tags: [[product-management]] 
- in feature teams most of the meaningful decisions have been made upstream by executives and stakeholders. In contrast, an empowered product team is all about pushing decisions down to the product team level. ([Location 2563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2563))
    - Tags: [[product-management]] 
- good decisions rest on a foundation of integrity—you are perceived as being dependable in your commitments, you are believed to be acting in the best interests of the company, and you're willing to be accountable to the results. ([Location 2573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2573))
- I (Marty) will admit I have always wanted the people who work for me to like me. But I want them to like me for very specific reasons. ([Location 2828](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2828))
- Ask yourself, what are the behaviors that may have served you well earlier in your career, but now are no longer advantages? ([Location 2947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=2947))

- A good product vision leverages relevant industry trends and technologies that we believe can help us solve problems for our customers in ways that are just now possible. ([Location 3800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=3800))

- More generally, the topology helps answer the question of how a company should organize its product people into teams to best enable them to do great work. ([Location 4147](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=4147))
- Autonomy does mean that when we give teams problems to solve, they have enough control so that they can solve the problem in the best possible way that they see fit. A topology that results in too many dependencies can make this difficult. ([Location 4213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=4213))
- Platform teams provide leverage because they allow for common services to be implemented once but used in many places. ([Location 4257](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=4257))
    - Tags: [[product-management]] 
- if a product team is working on the experience for anyone who is part of the company's customers—including consumers—this is called a customer‐facing experience team. ([Location 4278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=4278))
    - Tags: [[product-management]] 
- If a product team is working on a product experience for these types of internal employees, this is called a customer‐enabling experience team. ([Location 4282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=4282))
    - Tags: [[product-management]] 
- The bottom line is that there is no reason that reporting relationships should dictate team topology. ([Location 4454](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=4454))
- In terms of empowered product teams, product strategy helps us decide what problems to solve, product discovery helps us figure out the tactics that can actually solve the problems, and product delivery builds that solution so we can bring it to market. ([Location 4681](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=4681))

- The main thing is to keep the main thing, the main thing. ([Location 4730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=4730))

- Good strategy works by focusing energy and resources on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes. ([Location 4824](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08LPKRD5L&location=4824))
    - Tags: [[Leadership]] [[product-management]] 
- Good strategy … does not pop out of some “strategic management” tool, matrix, chart, triangle, or fill‐in‐the‐blanks scheme. Instead, a talented leader identifies the one or two critical issues in the situation—the pivot points that can multiply the effectiveness of effort—and then focuses and concentrates action and resources on them.
