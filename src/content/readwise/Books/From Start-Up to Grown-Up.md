## Highlights
- When you tell people what’s going on with you and what you need to change, they can open up and tell you what’s happening inside of them too. Vulnerability yields vulnerability. You are working on yourself, and that gives everyone permission to work on themselves too. ([Location 648](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B36PSK6&location=648))

- When you act like you’ve got it all figured out, people often shut down because they don’t feel they can add any value. If your people never see a chink in your armor, they also don’t see a human being they can connect to. ([Location 750](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B36PSK6&location=750))

- That’s why authenticity is so nuanced. It’s as much a learned skill as anything else. ([Location 754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B09B36PSK6&location=754))

- I like the framework developed by Ken Blanchard. He called it “commitment and competence,” what most people now call the “will and skill” framework.2 It aims to determine how willing and able someone is to take on a new task.

- But let’s start with the core skills you should discuss with your managers. These are: role modeling, cascading information, coaching, giving feedback, helping with career development, and goal setting and accountability.

- Moving fast is rarely about asking people to work harder. Moving fast arises when your employees have clarity about the plan, work the plan, and debrief and course-correct when something isn’t working according to plan.
