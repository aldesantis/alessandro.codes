In an ideal world, prestige and wealth would go hand in hand: the more prestigious someone is, the more wealth they should be able to accumulate.

Unfortunately, reality is often much different: there are a lot of people who are prestigious but not wealthy (think “hot startup founders”), and a lot of people who are wealthy but not prestigious (think “old wealth”).

In the short term, you should clearly understand how much you’re looking for prestige vs. wealth.

In the long term, you should work on aligning your prestige level with your wealth—but keep in mind that perfect alignment is a dream.
