Turning your brand into a source of social capital is a quick way to boost organic growth. You can do this by effectively activating your brand’s purpose (see [[brands-need-to-activate-their-purpose|Brands need to activate their purpose]]) so that buying from you becomes a statement about one’s own values rather than a mere transaction.
