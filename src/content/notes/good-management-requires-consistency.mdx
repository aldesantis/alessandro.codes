Just like [[advertising-must-be-consistent|Advertising must be consistent]], one of the critical factors to being a good manager is consistency in your behaviors.

Of course, your management, coaching, and leadership skills are extremely important, and youâ€™ll build those up with experience, but small things, done well, will take you a long way.

Never forgo the small things for the big things: being a visionary leader is no replacement for caring about people and taking time to chat with them.

The ultimate result of consistency is the complete absence of crisis. Good managers are hard to spot because they do their jobs so consistently that you can barely notice it.
