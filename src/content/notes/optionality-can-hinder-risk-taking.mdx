While it’s true that [[optimism-requires-diversification|Optimism requires diversification]], you need to be careful not to diversify and protect yourself so much that you forget to take risks.

There’s a very thin line between building optionality so that you can then pursue an ambitious path, and building optionality as a way to shield yourself from the dangers of life, which ultimately means you’ll never accomplish anything disruptive.
