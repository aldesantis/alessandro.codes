It is not always feasible for a brand to launch new products to expand their IP.

A brand that not only produces its own content but curates third-party content expands their universe and increases “depth,” acquiring social/cultural capital and keeping its audience engaged. It increases the social value of the brand.

That said, curation is harder to monetize, so it’s not always the right strategy.
