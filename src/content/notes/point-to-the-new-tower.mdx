When you’re scaling your organization, you will ask people to conitnuously reinvent themselves and take on new sets of responsibilities. This can be very unsettling for some people, because no one likes to give away their toys.

A helpful pattern is to always point people not to the tower they’re leaving behind, but rather to the new shiny tower that needs to be built: tell them about the exciting opportunities that you’re opening up for them.
