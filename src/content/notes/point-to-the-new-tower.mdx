When you’re scaling your organization, you will ask people to reinvent themselves and take on new sets of responsibilities continuously. This can be very unsettling for some people because no one likes to give away their toys.

A helpful pattern is always pointing people not to the tower they’re leaving behind or the work that needs to be done, but rather to the new shiny tower that needs to be built: tell them about the exciting opportunities you’re opening up for them. This makes it easier for you to [[swimming-downstream-is-easier-than-swimming-upstream|swim downstream]] in the system.

This works even better if you already have someone building the new tower, e.g., a [[bright-spots-catalyze-change|bright spot that can catalyze change]].

This applies to both internal (e.g., team restructurings) and external (e.g., consulting gigs) change management, as it’s a fundamental trait of human psychology.
