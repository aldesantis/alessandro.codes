Because [[information-quality-is-decision-quality|the quality of your information shapes the quality of your decisions]], eliminating bias naturally leads to better decisions.

- [[reason-from-first-principles|Reason from first principles]]
- [[stories-are-not-facts|Separate facts from stories]]
- [[defensiveness-inhibits-learning|Avoid becoming defensive]]

These practices should be embedded into your [[design-an-operating-cadence|operating cadence]].
