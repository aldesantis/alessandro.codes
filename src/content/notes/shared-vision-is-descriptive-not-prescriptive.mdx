Building shared vision in an organization is important because [[an-operating-cadence-needs-shared-vision|An operating cadence needs shared vision]] and [[shared-vision-promotes-systems-thinking|Shared vision promotes systems thinking]].

But as a leader, you should always keep in mind that your personal vision is just that, a _personal_ vision—it’s not shared vision just because you’re in a position of authority.

You can’t compel people to enroll in or commit to a vision, because committing to or enrolling in a vision require freedom of choice. The best you can do if you compel people is to get compliance, and [[compliance-is-not-commitment|Compliance is not commitment]].

Instead, shared vision is _always_ the result of the individual visions of the people that already belong to your organization. A true shared vision built in this way is never at odds with people’s interests: it _is_ people’s interest.

With this in mind, there are two ways for a leader to build shared vision. Both should be pursued simultaneously:

- [[shared-vision-is-built-through-hiring|Shared vision is built through hiring]]
- [[shared-vision-is-built-through-inquiry|Shared vision is built through inquiry]]
