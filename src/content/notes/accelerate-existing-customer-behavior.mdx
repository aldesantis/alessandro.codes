Lifecycle marketing efforts work best when you work to accelerate existing customer behavior rather than attempting to stimulate new behavior altogether.

An example: if most customers buy product A, then product B after 8 weeks, can you bring that down to 6 weeks? On the other hand, getting them to buy product C rather than product B will be harder.
