Lifecycle marketing efforts work best when you work to accelerate existing customer behavior rather than attempting to stimulate new behavior altogether.

For example, if most customers buy product A, then product B after 8 weeks, it will be relatively easy to segment that cohort and bring the second-purchase timeframe down to 6 weeks. On the other hand, getting them to buy product C rather than product B would be much more challenging.
