Learning a new domain typically happens in four phases:

- **Wrong Intuition:** Initially, you are not even aware of what you don’t know, so you’re not sure of where you should focus your efforts. This phase should be dedicated to understanding the high-level [[explicit-knowledge-can-be-captured|explicit knowledge]] of the domain you’re studying.
- **Wrong Analysis:** Once you know where to focus your efforts, you still don’t master the concepts you should know. In this phase, you’re focused on mastering the explicit knowledge of your domain.
- **Right Analysis:** In this phase, you’ve mastered the details of the concepts you need to be effective at your job, but you still need to exercise deliberate attention to get it right. This prevents you from adapting the concepts to your context, seeing connections, and ultimately innovating. This is where you start transitioning from explicit to [[tacit-knowledge-is-hard-to-capture|tacit knowledge is hard to capture]].
- **Right Intuition:** In this phase, you don’t need deliberate effort to “get it right” anymore. In this phase, you have acquired enough tacit knowledge to focus on innovating. [[understand-the-rules-before-breaking-them|You understand the rules, which means you can break them.]]
