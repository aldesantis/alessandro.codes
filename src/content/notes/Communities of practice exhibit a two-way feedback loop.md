# Communities of practice exhibit a two-way feedback loop

There’s a two-way feedback loop between communities of practice and the “host” organization:

1. The organization sets the strategic direction and chooses to nurture and support certain communities of practice over others, depending on which capabilities the organization needs. Note, though, that the organization should only _support_ communities, not force their creation/direction ([[communities-of-practice-are-loosely-knit]]).
2. Communities of practice, through their own work, may also inform the organization’s strategic direction, or uncover new avenues to explore ([[Communities of practice exhibit a two-way feedback loop]]).
