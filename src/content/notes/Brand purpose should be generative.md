# Brand purpose should be generative

We’ve established that [[Brands should stand for purpose, not search for it]].

At the same time, it’s essential that your brand purpose does not limit your brand to a specific category. Instead, it should be broad enough to be applied to several categories as part of a coherent and cohesive business strategy.

Applying the purpose to a category is fundamental—[[Brands need to activate their purpose]]. Otherwise, your purpose is an empty corporate statement on your office walls.
