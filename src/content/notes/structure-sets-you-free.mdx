In an organization “structure” is any piece of process around _how_ people work (e.g., operating principles, policies, document templates, recurring meetings, etc.).

Unfortunately, structure is often viewed as useless overhead because it reminds people of red tape/bureaucracy.

Instead, having the right kind structure in place allows you to _eliminate_ overhead instead, by leeting you spend the majority of your time doing the work rather than thinking about how to do the work. This maximizes the value you get out of your time which, in turn, allows you to move faster and more deliberately than your competition.

You can think of creating structure as giving up some of your freedom, which is what makes your freedom to really acquire value: [[Freedom is only valuable when forgone].
