Because [[communities-of-practice-are-loosely-knit|communities-of-practice-are-loosely-knit]], they cannot be created by external forces such as management pressure. If they are important to the organization, they can only be supported and nurtured in the following ways:

- Almost always, “communities of practice” are already out there in some form, and they just need to be officially recognized and promoted.
- While communities of practice don’t have a rigid structure, there’s usually a small group of active contributors that can act as coordinators, linking people together and ensuring the community continues to develop over time. Finding and defining this core group is the best way to ensure the community survives in the face of business pressures.
- Legitimize participation through official recognition and support. Create an environment where the community of practice can thrive without smothering it (e.g., by giving its members enough time to participate).
- Remember that [[we-get-what-we-reward-for|We get what we reward for]]. If communities of practice are beneficial to your organization (and if you are a knowledge organization, they are), make sure to reward practitioners for their work!
