title: Serendipity requires randomness

You cannot stumble into something novel by sticking to your routine. Serendipity requires doing things you’ve never done before, meeting random people, reading random books, etc. This is how you find new things, make connections between different fields, create theories, etc.

The problem is that our lives are not engineered for randomness—they’re engineered for producing predictable outputs in predictable units of time.

This might seem at odds with the idea that you need to [[design-an-operating-cadence|Design an operating cadence]], but in reality, you just need to design an operating cadence that includes both routine and randomness, i.e., [[build-experimentation-guidelines|Build experimentation guidelines]].

Also see [[unknown-habits-impede-learning|Unknown habits impede learning]] for a similar concept.
