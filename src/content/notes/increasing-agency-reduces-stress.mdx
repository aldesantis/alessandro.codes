Stress is often caused by a perceived lack of control.

When you’re in a stressful environment or situation, the mere act of increasing your agency/your sense of control over the stressors reduces your levels of stress, regardless of whether you actually take action to reduce the stressors or not.

You can do this by [[focus-on-your-controllables|focusing on the controllables]].

Other factors that influence your stress resilience are [[social-support-reduces-stress|social support]] and [[self-complexity-increases-resiliency|self-complexity]].
