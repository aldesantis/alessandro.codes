Ideas can be categorized into one of two buckets:

- **Ideas that can be pre-rationalized.** This is when you have the elements to determine whether the idea will be successful _before_ trying it.
- **Ideas that can only be post-rationalized.** This is when you can only determine whether the idea is successful after trying it.

While we’d all love to live in a world where most ideas can be pre-rationalized with data and logic, this is not only possible, because:

- We live in a [[chaotic-systems-are-not-random|chaotic system]], which makes it extremely hard to draw a straight line from our actions to their results.
- All the data we rely on comes from the past, not the future. A “black swan” event can and will throw off all the odds.

This means that most ideas cannot be pre-rationalized; they can only be post-rationalized. We try them, and if they are successful, we construct a new theory of success around them, at which point others will follow in our footsteps. This is done best when you have strong [[build-experimentation-guidelines|experimentation guidelines]].

This is often what ends up happening anyway, even when we think we are pre-rationalizing: our attempts at pre-rationalization often work only because [[foresight-is-creation-not-prediction|the act of predicting the future is creating the conditions for the future to happen.]]

When done well, this is the only way for humanity to move forward and create the future we want to see. However, we should also keep in mind that [[post-rationalization-can-lead-to-survivorship-bias|post-rationalization can lead to survivorship bias]].
