When looking for a collab partner, you should look for someone who displays:

- _Brand alignment:_ they have a similar ethos, a similar culture, and/or similar values.
- _Product alignment:_ thereâ€™s an aesthetic or functional connection with your own product.
- _Cultural alignment:_ they make your brand relevant in the cultural landscape.
