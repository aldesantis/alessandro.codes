The TERA quotient attempts to provide a model around building trust. TERA stands for:

- **Tribe:** does the other person perceive you as belonging to their same tribe? Do they think you’re with them or against them? Will you get their perspective on this matter?
- **Expectations:** does the other person have clear expectations as to how this situation will play out? Do they know what’s coming/what to expect from you in similar situations?
- **Rank:** how strongly does the other person perceive the rank difference between you two? If their role in the relationship is reduced, they will feel less safe.
- **Autonomy:** how much “voice” does the other person have in this interaction? Are you pinning them into a corner or are you giving them freedom to express their thoughts?
