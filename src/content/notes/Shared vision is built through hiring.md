# Shared vision is built through hiring

Because [[Shared vision is descriptive, not prescriptive]], it follows that if you have a personal vision and want to build shared vision, one of the best things you can do is select your people carefully.

At the same time, remember that [[Shared vision is built through inquiry]]. You canâ€™t just hire people that match your vision perfectly: you need to be prepared to also accept and integrate their personal visions into the organization.

This is also effective if you are trying to steer the organization in a new direction. The new people will show everyone else the way and accelerate your vision building process, since [[Bright spots catalyze change]].
