There are three types of possible relationships between the consultant and its client:

- **Pair-of-hands:** The client tells the consultant what to do, and the consultant executes. It’s closer to outsourcing than actual consulting (even though it’s what the majority of so-called consultants actually do).
- **Expert:** The consultant tells the client what to do, and the client executes. While a step up from pair-of-hands, the risk is that the consultant will operate outside the client’s context and suggest ineffective solutions.
- **Collaborative:** The client and consultant are on equal footing; the consultant acts as a sounding board, a cheerleader, and a partner in crime in achieving an organizational goal. This is the most effective type of relationship.
