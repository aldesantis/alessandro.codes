If you’re a consumer brand selling wholesale, gaining or losing market share can cause you to enter into a positive or negative self-reinforcing feedback loop:

- If you’re gaining market share, that gives buyers justification for giving you more shelf space, which causes you to gain even more market share.
- If you’re losing market share, buyers may want to “cut their losses” and give you less shelf space, which causes you to lose even more shelf space.

This phenomenon happens because [[marketing-must-build-physical-availability|building market share requires physical availability]], and it’s the perfect example of how [[reinforcing-feedback-loops-can-be-self-enhancing-or-self-destructive|Reinforcing feedback loops can be self-enhancing or self-destructive]].
