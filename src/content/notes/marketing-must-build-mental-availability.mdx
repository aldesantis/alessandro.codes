In addition to [[marketing-must-build-physical-availability|physical availability]], marketing must also build mental availability. By this, we mean that it must reinforce the mental structures in the consumerâ€™s brain that allow the consumer to:

- Remember that your brand exists and what it does
- Identify your brand when they see it in the real world

To build mental availability, you need to hit consumers with advertising that is both [[advertising-must-be-memorable|memorable]] and [[advertising-must-be-consistent|consistent]].
