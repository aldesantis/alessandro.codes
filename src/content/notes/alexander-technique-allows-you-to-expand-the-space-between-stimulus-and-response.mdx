There’s a famous quote that’s typically attributed to Victor Frankl, although it’s not actually his:

> **_Between stimulus and response there is a space_**. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.

Alexander Technique allows you to expand the space between stimulus and response, increasing your ability to decide how to respond.

This works both for mental and physical stimuli.
