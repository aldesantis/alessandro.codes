While [[explicit-knowledge-can-be-captured|explicit knowledge can be captured]], tacit knowledge cannot be captured—or at least, not in a very practical way.

This is because tacit knowledge is internalized over time as the result of real-world interactions: as an example, it is common for great engineers to have a sense for what a beautiful system looks like, but also have trouble spelling it out.

This is why, when learning, you typically [[learning-is-a-four-phase-process|start from explicit and move to tacit]]: once you’ve absorbed and internalized explicit knowledge via standardized formats, you then move on to tacit knowledge which is best taught through mentoring and experience.
