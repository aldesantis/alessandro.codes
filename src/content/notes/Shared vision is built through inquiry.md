# Shared vision is built through inquiry

While [[Shared vision is built through hiring]], building a shared vision also means constantly inquiring into the personal visions of all of your team members and finding ways to harmonize them.

Personal visions will provide additional perspectives through which you can look at the shared vision, and they will make the shared vision more appealing, more tangible, easier to achieve.
