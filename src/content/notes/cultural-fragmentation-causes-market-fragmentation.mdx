title: Cultural fragmentation causes market fragmentation
---
Cultural fragmentation (which is typically caused by [[Information abundance causes cultural fragmentation|information abundance]]) leads to market fragmentation in an inverse U-shaped relationship:

- **Little cultural fragmentation** (i.e., monocultures) leads to quasi-monopolies. A single brand can dominate a huge segment of the market and easily [[Brand management aims to turn brands into landmarks|become a landmark]] in its category/territory.
- **Some cultural fragmentation** (i.e., subcultures) leads to opportunity. New market segments open up, allowing more brands to enter the market while still gaining meaningful market share.
- **Excessive cultural fragmentation** (i.e., monocultures) destroys the market. If [[Advertising may work by cultural imprinting|advertising works by cultural imprinting]], cultural fragmentation prevents brands from gaining meaningful market share because they cannot align with any single market segment. This leads to a highly transactional consumer-brand relationship.

To an extent, brands can fight this trend by relying on personalization (often [[AI allows hyper-personalization|powered by AI]]) and showing up differently for each customer. However, this also reinforces the problemâ€”see [[personalization-may-be-harmful|Personalization may be harmful]] and [[cultural-brands-are-bidirectional|Cultural brands are bidirectional]].

This is very similar to how [[excessive-cultural-fragmentation-causes-social-isolation|Excessive cultural fragmentation causes social isolation]], which partially explains the relationship between social bonding and commerce.
