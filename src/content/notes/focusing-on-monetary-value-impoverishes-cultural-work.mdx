title: Focusing on monetary value impoverishes cultural work
---
When we look at cultural objects through the lens of their monetary value, we impoverish them. This is because:

- It attracts the wrong kind of consumer, i.e., one that trades in cultural objects to profit from them rather than to make them available. See, for example, what happens at the [Geneva Freeport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Freeport).
- It leads artists (in the broadest sense) to over-optimize for monetary value, which means pre-rationalizing rather than post-rationalizing ([[most-ideas-can-only-be-post-rationalized|Most ideas can only be post-rationalized]]).

This isnâ€™t to say that cultural work should be completely detached from economics. Instead, both artists and consumers should remember that [[money-is-like-oxygen|Money is like oxygen]] and [[focus-on-the-process-not-the-outcome|Focus on the process, not the outcome]].

As a corollary, because [[nfts-create-transparency-into-the-value-of-cultural-artifacts|NFTs create transparency into the value of cultural artifacts]], it follows that NFTs may do more harm than good for art.
