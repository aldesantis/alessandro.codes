# DTC has long been about arbitrage

DTC’s underlying strategy, for a long time, has been to identify the most interesting arbitrage opportunity and capitalize on it before it’s exhausted.

This used to be buying products from a factory in China, marketing them through cheap Meta ads and good branding, and re-selling them at a premium.

This strategy doesn’t work anymore.
