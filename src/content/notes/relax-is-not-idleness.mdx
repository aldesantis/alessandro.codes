title: Relax is not idleness

Often, we “relax” by doing nothing and succumbing to brain rot, e.g., by watching TV shows or playing video games for hours on end just to numb the mind.

The mind doesn’t work like that: it doesn’t need complete idleness to rest. Instead, it needs to be engaged in activities that are different from usual.
