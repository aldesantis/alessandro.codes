# Memory is for context

Memory gives you a web of facts/references that you can use to put new information into context. It allows you to answer questions with deduction, without having to look up key facts.

As an example, if you learn the signature traits of a historical period, you can put events from that period into the right context much more easily, reaching richer, more interesting conclusions.

To bake ideas into memory, remember that [[Ideas need to be grappled with]].
