Instead of focusing on your outcomes (lagging metrics), which are not controllable in most situations, you should determine which inputs (leading metrics) will influence the desired outcomes and focus on those instead.

This is the core principle behind, for example, [Activity Based Selling](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/activity-based-selling): no matter how hard you try, you can’t directly control how much revenue you bring in; you can only control how many calls you make or how many emails you send.

However, this doesn’t mean you should completely _ignore_ your outcomes—that wouldn’t be healthy either. It’s important to invest in pursuits where the worst-case scenario is an [[there-are-three-types-of-failure|intelligent failure]], and it’s important to know when to stop.

Focusing on the controllables is also the best way to [[increasing-agency-reduces-stress|increase agency and reduce stress.]]
