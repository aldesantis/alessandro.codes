Instead of focusing on your output, which is not controllable, you should determine which input metrics will influence the desired output metric and focus on those instead.

This is the core principle behind, for example, [Activity Based Selling](https://www.pipedrive.com/en/blog/activity-based-selling): no matter how hard you try, you can’t directly control how much revenue you bring in; you can only control how many calls you make or how many emails you send.

However, this doesn’t mean you should completely _ignore_ your output—that wouldn’t be healthy either. It’s important to know [[how-do-you-know-when-to-stop-versus-when-to-push-through-you-don’t-not-even-in-hindsight.-but-these-guiding-questions-can-help.|when to stop]] and look for [[there-are-three-types-of-failure|intelligent failures]].
