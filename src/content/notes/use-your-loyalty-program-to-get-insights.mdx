title: Use your loyalty program to get insights
---
One good use of loyalty programs is to collect insights and data, e.g., through surveys, focus groups, etc.

While this is valuable, you should also be mindful of self-selection bias: someone who’s enrolled in your loyalty program and goes out of their way to talk to you is most likely NOT your average customer, so you should not generalize the insights you get from them.
