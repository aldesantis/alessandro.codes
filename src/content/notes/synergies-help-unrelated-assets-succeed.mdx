If you hold a bunch of unrelated assets, building synergies can help tie them together and increase their performance. An example would be Prime for all of Amazon’s services, or Apple One for Apple services.

They are the “uniting force.”

In e-commerce, [[membership-is-a-type-of-synergy|Membership is a type of synergy]].
