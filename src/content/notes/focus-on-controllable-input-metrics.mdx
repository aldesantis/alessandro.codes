title: Focus on controllable input metrics
---
Instead of focusing on your output, which is not controllable, you should determine which input metrics will influence the desired output metric and focus on those instead.

#tbd How do you find input metrics from output metrics?

This is the core principle behind, for example, activity-based sales: you can’t control how much you’re selling, you can only control e.g. how many leads you call per day.
