title: Explicit knowledge can be captured

Explicit knowledge is characterized by the fact that it can be captured in some form: it can be a book, a course, a seminar, or any other medium. It is the most basic form of knowledge, and the one we usually think about when we imagining expertise.

For example, if Iâ€™m studying a new programming language, the syntax rules of the language can always be found in a manual.

This is in contrast with tacit knowledge, which [[tacit-knowledge-cannot-be-captured|cannot be captured]].
