Good consultants work on problems in isolation and then come back to the client with the solution.

Great consultants, on the other hand, actively involve the client in developing the solution because they know that [[effective-change-requires-collaboration|Effective change requires collaboration]].

This includes minor and apparently irrelevant touchpoints, such as asking the client to add their own items to the agenda at the beginning of a meeting, and major activities, such as involving the client in solution design and implementation.

This practice maximizes alignment with the clientâ€™s goals and constraints and ensures client buy-in at all project stages, leading to more successful engagements.
