# Conversion is fleeting, maturation is stable

There are two ways for people to change: conversion and maturation.

- **Conversion** is when a person or situation changes _suddenly_, as a result of an _external_ force or influence.
- **Maturation** is when a person or situation changes _gradually_, as a result of _internal_ search and reflection.

## Conversion is fleeting

 St. Paul experienced a conversion: he saw God on his way to Damascus and became a Christian. Paul will spend his entire life fearing a second conversion, which may, once again, lead him astray from Christianity.

 This is the big problem with conversion: it is fleeting. Because it’s externally imposed, you can’t know when you are going to experience another conversion which may completely reverse the first one.

 Conversion puts you at the mercy of others.

## Maturation is stable

Maturation is genuine and stable, and it stands the test of time. Maturation is, by definition, not susceptible to external forces. It’s the result of a deliberate and long process of research, reflection and comparison.

Maturation leads to long-lasting change, because [[Ideas need to be grappled with]].
