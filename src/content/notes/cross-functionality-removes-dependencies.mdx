title: Cross-functionality removes dependencies
---
As you move down the [[cross-functionality-is-a-spectrum|cross-functionality spectrum]], you remove more and more dependencies, which is a good thing because it allows you to move faster without getting blocked.

Unfortunately, fewer dependencies also means less communication. After all, if you don’t _need_ to talk to other people to do your job, you will naturally talk less to them. This is especially true for practices such as engineering which require a lot of “deep focus” time.

If not counterfought (e.g. by [[communities-of-practice-combat-cross-functional-silos|fostering communiteis of practice]]), this reduction in communication can ultimately lead to the [[cross-functionality-creates-silos|creation of silos]].
