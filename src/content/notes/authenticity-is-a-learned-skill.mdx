We think of authenticity as something that we simply have. In reality, authenticity for a leader is a learned skill as anything else: you need to be authentic enough for people to recognize that you’re an actual human being that they can relate to, but not so authentic that you let your negative emotions affect people’s performance.

Your authenticity must always be balanced and kept in check if you want to use it at the service, and not at the expense, of the organization. The goal is to show people that you are vulnerable and that you’re still working on yourself, even though you are the boss: by doing that, you give others permission to be vulnerable and work on themselves.
