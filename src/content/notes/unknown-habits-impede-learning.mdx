_Known_ habits are a good thing insofar as their ability to create a structure, because [[structure-sets-you-free|Structure sets you free]]. An operating cadence, for example, is a known habit (see [[design-an-operating-cadence|Design an operating cadence]]).

However, not all habits are evident: we sometimes form _unknown_ habits. Previously known habits may also become unknown when we stop actively thinking about them. When this happens, habits impede our learning because they turn into a blind spot that can’t be actively evaluated and improved upon.

To fight this tendency, it’s useful to periodically stop and make a list of known habits, continuously adding new ones to the list as they are formed and/or become known to us. This is a way to return to your origins and [[reason-from-first-principles|Reason from first principles]].
