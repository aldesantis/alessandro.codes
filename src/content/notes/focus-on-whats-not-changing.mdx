title: Focus on what’s not changing
---
Rather than focusing on what will change and trying to build a strategy around that, focus on what will NOT change in the foreseeable future. The typical example here is Jeff Bezos betting on the fact that Amazon’s consumers would always care about low prices and fast delivery.

By doing this, you’re effectively focusing on the fundamentals, and getting the fundamentals right also makes it easier to support innovative/one-shot bets.
