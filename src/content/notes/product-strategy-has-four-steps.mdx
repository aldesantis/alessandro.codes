title: Product strategy has four steps
---
## 1. Focus

Product strategy derives from _focus_ (see [[strategy-deals-with-present-challenges|Strategy deals with present challenges]]) on your productâ€™s vision and current objectives.

## 2. Insights

Once you have identified those objectives, you need _insights_. Unfortunately, there is no pre-defined process for getting insights. Instead, insights result from a talented leader having deep knowledge of their customers, industry, product, and company and using that knowledge to identify a few critical leverage points.

## 3. Action

These insights are converted into meaningful, well-directed _action_ (e.g., new product development).

## 4. Completion

Finally, the action must be managed to _completion_ (by going to market with the new product).
