- There’s a distinction between what people need and what they want.
- If you can bridge that gap, you can be extremely effective at what you do.
- This is swimming upstream (starting from what people need) vs. swimming downstream (starting from what people want).
- How to do this:
	- [[understand-the-rules-before-breaking-them]] - also helps you not to become overly arrogant
	- Learn to build stories ([[stories-are-not-facts]])
	- [[point-to-the-new-tower]]
	- Other change management principles
