When creating change, look for bright spots in your organization and use those as an example to replicate the behavior in other areas of the org: what teams are performing well? What’s making them effective? Point to those examples in the organization and use them as catalysts for change—after all, [[effective-change-requires-collaboration|effective change requires collaboration]].

However, you may not always be able to find a bright spot internally. In these cases, it may be worth creating an “artificial” bright spot, e.g., by hiring someone who exemplifies the behavior you want to see. This is not ideal, as this person will be perceived as an outsider and may not be received well, but it’s your second-best option.

Once you have them, you should use these bright spots as inspiring examples and to train the rest of the organization.
