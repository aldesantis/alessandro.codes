While [[strategy-deals-with-present-challenges|Strategy deals with present challenges]], not all present challenges must be tackled simultaneously. Deciding which hills to die on and which to ignore is a key part of strategic thinking.

When in doubt, focus on the bottleneck(s) preventing you from reaching the next [[work-toward-proximate-objectives|proximate objective]]. In doing this, remember to [[prioritize-strengths-over-weaknesses|Prioritize strengths over weaknesses]].

If you follow these principles, the resulting strategy should be simple yet effective ([[good-strategy-is-simple|Good strategy is simple]]).
