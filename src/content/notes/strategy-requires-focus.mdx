While [[strategy-deals-with-present-challenges|Strategy deals with present challenges]], not all present challenges must be tackled simultaneously. Deciding which hills to die on and which to ignore is a key part of strategic thinking.

When in doubt, [[systems-are-limited-to-one-input-at-a-time|focus on the most limiting input]], the one preventing you from reaching the next [[work-toward-proximate-objectives|proximate objective]]. In doing this, remember to [[prioritize-strengths-over-weaknesses|prioritize strengths over weaknesses]].

If you follow these principles, the resulting strategy should be [[good-strategy-is-simple|simple yet effective]].
