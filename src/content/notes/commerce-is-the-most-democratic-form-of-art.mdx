Everyone is involved in [[commerce]] in some way, shape, or form.

On its surface, commerce is just the trade of goods. But when you dig beneath the surface, you actually realize that [[brands-serve-two-purposes|brands serve two purposes]], a functional one and a cultural one.

That makes commerce a very accessible and democratic form of art, because it allows pretty much everyone, everywhere to express themselves within their means.
