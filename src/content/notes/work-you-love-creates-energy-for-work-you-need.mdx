	- The “[Manage your priorities and energy](https://lethain.com/frameworks-decision-making/)” chapter in [_The Engineering Executive’s Primer_](https://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Executives-Primer-Impactful-Leadership/dp/1098149483/) captures an important reality that took me too long to understand: the perfect allocation of work is not the mathematically ideal allocation that maximizes impact. Instead, it’s the balance between that mathematical ideal and doing things that energize you enough to stay motivated over the long haul. If you’re someone who loves writing software, that might involve writing a bit more than helpful to your team. If you’re someone who loves streamlining an organization, it might be improving a friction-filled process that is a personal affront, even if it’s not causing _that much_ overall inefficiency.
