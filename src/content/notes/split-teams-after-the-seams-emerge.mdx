A lot of leaders attempt to split teams pre-emptively, with a top-down approach. This might sometimes work, but it’s the path of highest resistance, because you need to [[align-teams-before-empowering-them|Align teams before empowering them]].

A more organic approach would be to let the seams emerge naturally: do some people focus on certain projects/features/disciplines, while other people naturally gravitate toward others? Look for commonalities (or differences!) and split teams based on what already exists, rather than some made-up structure that only exists in your mind. This will set the team up for success.
