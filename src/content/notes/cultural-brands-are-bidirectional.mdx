While regular brands exclusively work by imprinting themselves onto the culture (see [[advertising-works-by-emotional-inception-and-cultural-imprinting|Advertising may work by cultural imprinting]]), cultural brands establish a bidirectional relationship with culture: they are simultaneously building and influenced by the culture.

They do this by identifying a target/muse audience, participating in the cultural discourse (media, IRL activations, runway shows, resale platforms, etc.), and feeding that input into their marketing and product strategy.
