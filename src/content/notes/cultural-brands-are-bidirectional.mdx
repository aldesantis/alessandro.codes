title: Cultural brands are bidirectional
---
While regular brands exclusively work by imprinting themselves onto the culture (see [[advertising-may-work-by-cultural-imprinting|Advertising may work by cultural imprinting]]), cultural brands establish a bidirectional relationship with culture: they are simultaneously building and influenced by the culture.

They do this by identifying a target/muse audience and giving them the tools to remix the brand however they see fit.

## Open questions

- How do brands do this while still maintaining coherence and consistency? Or do they even need to worry about this?
- How do cultural brands convert cultural status into financial results?

## Examples

- A good example is the “brat” phenomenon kicked off by Charli XCX. Brat became, for all intents and purposes, a cultural brand by giving its audience a platform for expressing themselves and facilitating rather than leading the discussion.
