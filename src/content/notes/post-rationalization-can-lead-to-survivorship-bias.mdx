While it’s true that [[most-ideas-can-only-be-post-rationalized|Most ideas can only be post-rationalized]], we must always remember that [[the-map-is-not-the-territory|The map is not the territory]]. If we forget it, it can lead to

- Someone has the courage to try an idea that cannot be pre-rationalized.
- The idea is randomly successful, and industry pundits post-rationalize it, turning it into a [[be-wary-of-flawless-ideas|flawless idea]].
- The idea starts spreading even though it is not reproducible.

If the idea gets enough traction, it creates a bubble, which will eventually deflate once we realize it doesn’t hold up to scrutiny.
