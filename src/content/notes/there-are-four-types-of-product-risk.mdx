A startup typically faces four types of product risk:

- **Value Risk** (sometimes called “Complexity Uncertainty”): Do people want the product, and is there a big enough opportunity for it?
- **Usability Risk**: Can people figure out how to use the product?
- **Feasibility Risk** (sometimes called _“Novelty Uncertainty”_): Do we have the technical skills to build the product?
- **Viability Risk**: Can we make money off of the product?

While risk is dangerous, [[risk-protects-from-competition|it also protects you from competition]].
