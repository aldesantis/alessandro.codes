# Brand marketing is performance marketing

Many marketers consider brand marketing and performance marketing as two completely separate concepts. In their mind, brand marketing is a very long-term strategy that is not directly tied to a financial impact, while performance marketing is a very short-term strategy that is directly tied to a financial impact.

This is a flawed model: instead, marketers should distinguish between brand marketing and direct-response marketing, and they both fall in the bucket of performance marketing. This means that they should both draw from the same budget and they should both be measured, although in different ways due to the delayed nature of brand marketing activities:

- Brand marketing is typically measured through website traffic, social media engagement, etc.
- Direct-response marketing is typically measured through conversions.
