Your competitive advantage is most easily quantified as the gap between the perceived value of your products (i.e., your pricing power) or services and the cost you incur to deliver those services.

As a result, deepening your competitive advantage–which is the result of [[good-strategy-is-simple|good strategic thinking]]—always manifests in higher value or lower cost.

Note that this is slightly different from, although strictly correlated to, your profit margin: just because you _can_ charge X does not mean you _have_ to charge X. You can also use your competitive advantage to charge below your pricing power and deepen your market penetration.
