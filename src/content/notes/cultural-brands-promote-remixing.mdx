Not only [[cultural-brands-are-bidirectional|are cultural brands bidirectional]], but the best cultural brands also give their audience the tools and the freedom freedom to remix the brand’s narrative and visual language to create new artifacts.

A good example is the “brat” phenomenon kicked off by Charli XCX. Brat became, for all intents and purposes, a cultural brand by giving its audience a platform for expressing themselves and facilitating rather than leading the discussion.

## Open questions
