Research has shown that all organizations have pockets of high and low psychological safety. This is because psychological safety mostly happens at the team level rather than at the organization level.

It makes sense when you think about it: psychological safety is the belief that it’s safe for me to take a risk with someone else—that there will be no formal or informal punitive consequences. As such, it spreads vertically and horizontally in an organization rather than being isolated within an individual.
