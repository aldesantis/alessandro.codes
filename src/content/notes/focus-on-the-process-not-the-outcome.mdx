When you’re working in an environment with a long feedback loop, focusing on the outcome can be extremely detrimental to morale, because [[long-feedback-loops-create-frustration|Long feedback loops create frustration]].

It may be hard to know when it’s worth pushing through vs. when to stop. If you stop too early, you may negate your project a chance to succeed; if you don’t stop in time, you may be wasting valuable resources and speeding up your failure.

In these situations, you need to juggle two opposing forces.

On one hand, you need to focus on the process rather than the outcome to prevent yourself from stopping too early.

On the other, you need to track _some_ sort of leading KPI to prevent yourself from not stopping until it’s too late. One leading KPI can be your rate of progress: is your rate of progress toward the ultimate outcome accelerating or slowing?
