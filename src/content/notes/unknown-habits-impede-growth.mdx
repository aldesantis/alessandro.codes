_Known_ habits are a good thing insofar as they create a structure, because [[structure-sets-you-free|structure sets you free]]. For example, [[design-an-operating-cadence|an operating cadence]] is a known habit.

However, not all habits are evident: we sometimes form _unknown_ habits. Previously known habits may also become unknown when we stop actively thinking about them. When this happens, habits impede our learning because they become blind spots that can’t be actively evaluated and improved upon.

To fight this tendency, it’s useful to periodically stop and make a list of known habits, continuously adding new ones to the list as they are formed and/or become known to us. This is a way to go back to basics and [[reason-from-first-principles|reason from first principles]].
