Research has found that a more complex sense of self increases your resiliency to stress, because it reduces the “surface area” of the stressors. This is somewhat similar to how [[increasing-agency-reduces-stress|increasing agency reduces stress]], giving you a greater sense of control over the stressors even though you may never actually act on them.
