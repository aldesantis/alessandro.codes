title: Advertising may work by cultural imprinting
---
There are two schools of thought about how advertising works:

- **Emotional inception:** according to this theory, the ad makes you want to buy something directly. You see an ad for a BMW car, and the car looks appealing to you, which makes you desire it and eventually buy it.
- **Cultural imprinting:** according to this theory, the ad creates a cultural image of what a product signifies. You see an ad for a BMW car, and you equate BMWâ€™s brand with luxury, so you decide to buy the car to signal your wealth to others (and yourself).

## Other notes/counterarguments

- Is inception tied to direct-response marketing, while imprinting is tied to delayed-response/brand marketing?
- If ads work by imprinting, then [[advertising-must-be-consistent|Advertising must be consistent]] so that it sends the same message to everyone. Otherwise, the brand is diluted. This means that [[personalization-may-be-harmful|Personalization may be harmful]]
