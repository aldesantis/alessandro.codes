We always get what we reward for, which means we can shape reality by rewarding the right behaviors, and by being conscious about what we reward for.

When you think about it, this is pretty obvious: in a sufficiently large group, people are always going to do what gets them ahead of the others, and no one is going to do the activities that donâ€™t move the needle.

This is often how tech debt is born: when an organization rewards people for shipping features rather than building for the long-term, tech debt accrues because no one is getting rewarded for thinking about it.
