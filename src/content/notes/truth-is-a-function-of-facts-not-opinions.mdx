Having people who agree with you does not make you right, just like having people who disagree with you does not make you wrong.

Only facts (and [[stories-are-not-facts|not stories]]) can tell you whether you are right or wrong.

This is also true for other people: when asked for their opinion, they often become pretenders and liars, as they tend to present their ideal version of themselves. Instead, you should always look at what they do.

A classic example is the consumer’s stance towards ESG values in their consumption choices: when asked in a poll, consumers will happily tell you that they prioritize ethical sourcing and responsible manufacturing practices over everything else. When you look at their choices, you’ll find that they often prioritize price and convenience over everything else.
