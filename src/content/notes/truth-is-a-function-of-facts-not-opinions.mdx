Having people who agree with you does not make you right, any more than having people who disagree with you makes you wrong.

Only facts (and [[stories-are-not-facts|not stories]]) can tell you whether you are right or wrong.

This is also true of others: when asked for their opinion, they often become pretenders and liars, presenting their idealized version of themselves. Instead, you should always look at what they do.

A classic example is the consumer’s stance towards ESG values in their consumption choices. When asked in a poll, consumers will happily tell you that they prioritize ethical sourcing and responsible manufacturing practices over everything else. When you look at their choices, you’ll find that they often prioritize price and convenience over everything else. See, for instance, [this AB test](https://afina.com/blogs/news/made-in-usa).
