title: There are three types of non-fiction works

There are three types of non-fiction works:

- **Branch works:** These are centered on a single [[non-fiction-must-revolve-around-a-shiny-dime|shiny dime]], and the rest of the book is padded with further explanations, real-world examples, etc.
- **Tree works:** These explain an entire system of thought, end-to-end. The [[non-fiction-must-revolve-around-a-shiny-dime|shiny dime]] is still there (or should be, if the book is good), but it may be more elaborate.
- **Narrative works:** These are biographies, memoirs, etc. These tell you about the history of something or someone. Example: Steve Jobsâ€™ biography.
