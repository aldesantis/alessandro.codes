Cultural fragmentation (which is typically caused by [[information-abundance-causes-cultural-fragmentation|information abundance]]) is in an inverse U-shaped relationship with social cohesion:

- **Little cultural fragmentation** (i.e., monocultures) creates weak social bonds. While monocultures lead (by definition) individuals to have a single worldview, the social bonds that result form this worldview are weak due to the lack of intentionality.
- **Some cultural fragmentation** (i.e., subcultures) creates strong social bonds. When I can choose between group A and group B ([[common-enemies-unite-individuals|Common enemies unite individuals]]), I will be more invested in my choice.
- **Excessive cultural fragmentation** (i.e., monocultures) destroys social bonds. While the amount and speed of content increases, our ability to process content stays fixed, reducing the likelihood of finding commonalities with other individuals.

This is problematic because isolation and the lack of social cohesiveness brings about a number of negative consequences, such as [[social-support-reduces-stress|a reduction in stress tolerance]].
