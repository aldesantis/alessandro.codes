title: Lean is about cheap iteration
---
People often think of Lean as the only possible methodology for product development just because it’s the most popular one. In reality, Lean is just one way to build products, but there are other, equally valid ways:

- Amazon’s Working Backwards
- Pixar’s Braintrust
- Apple’s Creative Selection

At the end of the day, what all these methodologies have in common is that they’re a cheap ways to iterate through ideas until you find the optimal one.

Product development is about shipping and iterating as quickly and as cheaply as possible.
