title: Groups always have structure

Thereâ€™s no such thing as a structureless group: even groups without a formal structure will still have a structure. Very often, such groups will not have the optimal structure: in the absence of structure, dynamics of power come into play and the strongest/smartest tend to dominate over the others.
