Just like good management (see [[good-management-requires-consistency|Good management requires consistency]]), good advertising requires consistency over a long time horizon to [[marketing-must-build-mental-availability|build mental availability]].

When we talk about “consistency” in this context, we mean it in two senses:

- **Visual consistency**, in the sense that your brand must always show up in the same way. Otherwise, the consumer will have a hard time identifying your brand. This is one of the reasons why [[personalization-may-be-harmful|Personalization may be harmful]].
- **Temporal consistency**, in the sense that you need to keep hitting the consumer at recurring intervals. Otherwise, you will either not break through OR the consumer will forget about your brand.
