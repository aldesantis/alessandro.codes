# Managers operate on two horizons

#management

All good managers are constantly operating on two horizons: on one hand, they never lose sight of the big picture, because thatâ€™s how they can motivate their teams and make strategic decisions. On the other, they connect the big picture to the short term stuff, and they make sure that it consistently gets done well.
