There are three types of failure archetypes:

- **Preventable failures (bad):** These happen when someone fails to follow a clearly established process. They were entirely avoidable.
- **Complex failures (bad):** these happen due to complex and often subtle interactions between agents in the system that ultimately lead to error. These might have been preventable with better processes and/or greater psychological safety.
- **Intelligent failures (good):** These are failures that are the regular result of doing your work. An R&D department, for example, will fail continuously as unrealistic projects are shut down. In an environment where intelligent failure is the norm, failure to fail is, in itself, a failure.
