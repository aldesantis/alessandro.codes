When introducing some kind of change, whether it be technical, cultural, or of some other form, you will need to collaborate with others to be effective. This is because of two reasons.

Getting people to collaborate on change is a powerful way to guarantee buy-in, no matter your role in the process. Even if you’re the CEO, you _will_ encounter resistance if you try to create change in a vacuum.
