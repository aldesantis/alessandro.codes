Codebases should be built for humans, not machines, because theyâ€™re inhabited by humans.

Building a codebase for humans means optimizing it for maintainability and thinking about how a human will read and navigate the codebase.

Building a codebase for machines means throwing code at the machine and knowing that it will interpret it correctly, with no regard for whether that code will also be interpretable by a human.
