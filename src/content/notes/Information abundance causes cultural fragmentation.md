# Information abundance causes cultural fragmentation

As information becomes more abundant and more easily accessible, culture becomes more and more fragmented.

In the past, people had a relatively unified view of the world because everyone had access to the same media and the same content. We were in a **monoculture.**

As media and content started multiplying, we transitioned from a monoculture to **subcultures:** groups of people that were defined by shared values and worldviews.

However, the modern social structure is not the subculture anymore. This is because media channels and content are more abundant than ever and are moving more quickly than ever—no one can keep up.

This causes a shift from shared values and worldviews to the more superficial and fleeting concept of aesthetics. As a result, we are quickly moving from subcultures to **solocultures:** a view of the world that is a single individual’s and no one else’s.

This is problematic for a few different reasons:

- [[Excessive cultural fragmentation causes social isolation]]
- [[Cultural fragmentation causes market fragmentation]]
