When you believe there’s a gap between what the system needs and what the system wants, it is your duty to change the system. In doing this, you have two options:

- **You can start from what the system needs—AKA “swimming upstream.”** This means leveraging brute force to change the system from the outside.
- **You can start from what the system wants—AKA “swimming downstream.”** This means leveraging the system’s existing mechanisms to change it from the inside.

While it may seem heroic and virtuous, swimming upstream is, by definition, incredibly hard because [[systems-strive-for-self-preservation|systems strive for self-preservation]]. The system will treat you like a foreign body and resist you at every turn, and you will be much more likely to fail in your endeavour.

**In most systems, the correct strategy is actually to swim downstream.** As impossible as it may seem in the short term, by [[learn-the-rules-before-breaking-them|learning the system’s rules]] and operating within its boundaries, you can gradually get the system to where you want it to be.

In practice, there are a few strategies to make this happen:

- [[point-to-the-new-tower|Point to the new tower.]] Rather than focusing on what the system must leave behind, focus on what it is gaining. This allows you to redirect the current energy in the system to a new, more productive endeavor.
- [[stories-are-not-facts|Tell a story.]] Stories help bridge the gap between what the system needs and what it wants. A compelling story can help you show that everything the system wants is on the other side of the change you are envisioning.
- [[bright-spots-catalyze-change|Look for the bright spots.]] In any given system that requires change, there are usually bright spots that have already internalized that change. Use them to educate yourself and inspire others about how such a change can exist within such a system.

AKA: Systems want to be danced with.
