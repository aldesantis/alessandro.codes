Because [[shared-vision-is-descriptive-not-prescriptive|Shared vision is descriptive, not prescriptive]], it follows that if you have a personal vision and want to build shared vision, one of the best things you can do is select your people carefully.

At the same time, remember that [[shared-vision-is-built-through-inquiry|Shared vision is built through inquiry]]. You canâ€™t just hire people that match your vision perfectly: you need to be prepared to also accept and integrate their personal visions into the organization.

This is also effective if you are trying to steer the organization in a new direction. The new people will show everyone else the way and accelerate your vision building process, since [[bright-spots-catalyze-change|Bright spots catalyze change]].
