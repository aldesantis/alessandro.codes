The ultimate goal of any brand management strategy should be to turn your brand into a reference for its category.

A couple of examples: when you think soda, you think Coca-Cola; when you think fast food, you think McDonald’s.

This takes time, and it’s become much harder to do because of cultural fragmentation: [[cultural-fragmentation-causes-market-fragmentation|Cultural fragmentation causes market fragmentation]].
