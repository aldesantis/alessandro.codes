When you’re attempting to change a system, remember that a system’s primary directive is to preserve itself. Unfortunately, this tendency can and will often become unhealthy if the system is optimizing for short-term comfort at the expense of long-term survival or if the system is acting on [[information-quality-is-decision-quality|bad information]].

A couple of examples:

- The CEO running their startup into the ground because they don’t know how to delegate and have become a bottleneck for the entire team.
- The founder stubbornly pursuing a “premiumization” strategy for their consumer brand despite mounting pricing pressure on the entire category.

To overcome these situations, you need to [[understand-the-rules-before-breaking-them|understand the incentives that are driving the system]], and only then can you attempt to redirect its energy to more healthy endeavors.

However, this needs to be done with loving care: the more you attempt to fight the system, the more the system will reject you. In these situations, you can rely on tried-and-true change management principles, such as [[bright-spots-catalyze-change|looking for bright spots]] and [[point-to-the-new-tower|pointing to the new tower]].
