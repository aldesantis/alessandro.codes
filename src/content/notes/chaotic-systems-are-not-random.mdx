There’s a difference between random systems and chaotic systems:

- In a **random system**, there is no direct correlation between inputs and outputs. You have literally zero control over what happens in the system.
- In a **chaotic system**, there is a loose correlation between inputs and outputs. As much as we try to draw a good map of them, [[the-map-is-not-the-territory|The map is not the territory]]: you can’t control individual inputs to get specific outputs. However, you can shape the larger system to steer it toward a desired direction.

Advertising is a good example: despite what we’d like to believe, it’s hard to influence long-term purchase behavior with an individual ad or marketing campaign. However, by building physical and mental availability over a long period, you are _guaranteed_ to eventually influence purchase behavior, even though the results might be hard to track back to a specific action you took.
