While it may seem counterintuitive, predicting the future is one of the most effective ways to create the future. When you predict _X_, assuming you have the right reach or that this operation is repeated enough times, you are effectively bending the future in the direction of _X_.

Depending on how you look at this, it can be either depressing (“No one knows anything”) or liberating (“Stop predicting things that cannot be predicted; start manifesting the future you want to see”).

This is the job of a good futurist: to simultaneously predict the future and imprint their vision of the future onto the world.
