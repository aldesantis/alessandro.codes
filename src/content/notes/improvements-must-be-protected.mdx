If you invest in a business improvement attainable by everyone else, you have not created a competitive advantage. At most, you have unlocked the capacity to deploy to work on more meaningful innovations.

Meaningful improvements are hard to replicate (e.g., because they require knowledge accumulated through the years) or do not make sense outside of your business (e.g. because they are intrinsically tied to your culture/how you operate).
