# turn-transient-notes-into-evergreen-notes

Transient notes are valuable scratchpads for supporting working memory, but knowledge should accrete (see [[Note-Writing Practices Provide Weak Feedback - Andy Matuschak Notes - Obsidian Publish|Note-Writing Practices Provide Weak Feedback]], [[Designing a Better Thinking-Writing Medium]]). Transient notes should be an input for evergreen notes, which you refine and cultivate over time ([[Ideas need to be grappled with]]).

Evergreen notes allow you to see relationships of similarity and contradictions between different ideas you experience and different angles from which to view those ideas. It allows you to extend your “mental RAM” across an infinite timespan to form deeper considerations about a topic ([[Writing is thinking across time]]).

The difference between transient notes vs. evergreen notes is similar to the difference between a PowerPoint presentation and Amazon’s famous 6-page memos: the memos were better because they forced people to think through ideas at a deeper level and see their interconnectedness rather than simply spitting out data and concepts on a few slides and calling it a day (something that’s discussed in [[Working Backwards]]).
