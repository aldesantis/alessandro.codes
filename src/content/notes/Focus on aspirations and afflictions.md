# Focus on aspirations and afflictions

When selling to a customer, you should uncover:

- Aspirations: the goals they want to achieve.
- Afflictions: the challenges they want to overcome.

Then, in your sales process, you should focus on both. Help them see how your solution will help them achieve their aspirations and eliminate their afflictions.
