There are two phases to any project:

- **divergence**, which is the collection of elements (qualitative and quantitative data, hypotheses, opinions, etc.) that will assist you during the execution,
- **convergence**, which is the unification of all the data you have collected into a coherent strategy (remember that [[strategy-requires-focus|Strategy requires focus]]).

The more perfectionist you are, the harder it will be to reach convergence because you will be constantly looking for new elements to refine your strategy.

To an extent, curiosity may also delay convergence because youâ€™ll always want to gather one more piece of data.
