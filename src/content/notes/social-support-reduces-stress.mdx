A social support network can reduce stress, even when the stressors remain the same.

This is because of two reasons:

- Having a social network helps you better weather your stressors.
- Having a social network increases the complexity of your sense of self, and [[self-complexity-increases-resiliency|a more complex sense of self makes you more resilient]].

This is similar to how [[increasing-agency-reduces-stress|increasing agency reduces stress]], even though you may not actually exercise your agency to alter your stressors.
