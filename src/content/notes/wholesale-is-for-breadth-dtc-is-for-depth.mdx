[[every-sales-channel-has-its-purpose|Every sales channel has its purpose]]. In the case of the wholesale/DTC conundrum (no matter whether we’re talking about physical or digital DTC), most brands should think about is as a breadth vs. depth distinction:

- Wholesale allows you to reach a very broad set of customers in a very short amount of time. At the same time, it doesn’t give you much data or many opportunities to connect with those customers.
- DTC is harder to pull off because you need to bring customers to your own channel, but it gives you a lot of first-party data and allows you to completely own the customer experience.

At the same time, you should also be mindful that [[wholesale-boosts-brand-awareness|Wholesale boosts brand awareness]], which in turn will bring people into your channels. That’s why [[sales-channels-must-be-integrated|Sales channels must be integrated]], so that you can amplify that effect even further.
