You cannot change a system until you understand how it operates and the mechanisms it enacts to [[systems-strive-for-self-preservation|preserve itself]]. Before you break the rules, you need to go through the process of [[learning-is-a-four-phase-process|learning why they exist]].

This will enable you to [[swimming-downstream-is-easier-than-swimming-upstream|swim downstream]] when you attempt to change the system.
