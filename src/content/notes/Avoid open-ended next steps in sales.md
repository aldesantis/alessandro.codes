# Avoid open-ended next steps in sales

In a sales conversation, you should avoid open-ended next steps like the plague. This is when the call ends with the client saying they’ll get back to you without specifying _when_ exactly they’ll get back to you.

Open-ended next steps put you in a dynamic of subservience rather than peer, weakening your prospects of winning the client.

Instead, push the client for a clear and actionable next step.
