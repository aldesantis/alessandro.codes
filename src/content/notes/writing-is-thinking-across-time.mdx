> Our brains are good at thinking moment to moment, but not over time, especially across days and weeks and months. Writing helps us think better because it allows us to _think across time_. At any moment, our minds can only hold and connect a handful of related ideas and memories. When we try to multiply big numbers in our head or understand complex situations, that limitation we run into is the limitation of how much we can think at once – we can only think a few thoughts clearly at once, so to create vast maps of ideas, we need a larger surface. When we take notes, we render our thoughts onto paper so that we can hold onto them even when they aren’t at the top of our minds. We can lay out a hundred different ideas on paper and move them around to connect them and group them easily.
