title: Be wary of flawless ideas
---
When an idea is blatantly wrong or flawed, it’s easy to dismiss.

But there’s another category of ideas, which are much sneakier: “flawless” ideas. These are initiatives, plans, and strategies that seem to make perfect sense at first: in our mind, there’s a direct connection between action and result, we have a plan to deal with all contingencies, and nothing could possibly go wrong.

Our minds love flawless ideas because [[human-beings-hate-uncertainty|Human beings hate uncertainty]].

Unfortunately, reality is much more complex than our mental model of it. Most flawless ideas are only flawless because we are [[the-map-is-not-the-territory|swapping the territory for its map]] and we are failing to account for a number of potential problems or sources of entropy. When they face the real world, they’ll break down in a nanosecond because they are inserted in a [[chaotic-systems-are-not-random|chaotic system]]. This leads to problems such as:

- [[correlation-is-not-causation|Confusing correlation and causation]]
- [[post-rationalization-can-lead-to-survivorship-bias|Post-rationalization can lead to survivorship bias]]

This is one of the reasons why [[ideas-need-to-be-grappled-with|Ideas need to be grappled with]]: because it helps us uncover their flaws and blind spots, and it keeps us honest.
