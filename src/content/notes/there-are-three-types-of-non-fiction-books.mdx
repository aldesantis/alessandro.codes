There are three types of non-fiction books: narrative books, tree book sand branch books.

## Narrative books

These are biographies, memoirs, etc. These tell you about the history of something or someone. Example: _A Brief History of Humankind_.

## Tree books

These explain an entire system of thought, end-to-end. Example: _The Fifth Discipline_.

Tree books cannot be skimmed or summarized, because the content is too dense and you would lose too much in the translation.

## Branch books

These explain a single idea, and the rest of the book is padded with further explanations, real-world examples, etc. Example: _Radical Candor_.

These are usually a subset of some tree book and they can be easily summarized (e.g. by using a tool such as [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/en/nc/library/)).
