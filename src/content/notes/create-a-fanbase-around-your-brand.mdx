A powerful community-building strategy is to create a fanbase around your brand. Fans are not there to create something new, but to re-interpret what your brand does.

For fans, the ultimate currency is status and cultural/social capital.

There are different ways to build a fanbase. In terms of CX, you can use your loyalty program to encourage the kind of activity you want to see more of.

For instance, you should [[build-your-loyalty-program-with-tiers-not-balances|Build your loyalty program with tiers, not balances]], to encourage a sense of belonging rather than transactionality.
