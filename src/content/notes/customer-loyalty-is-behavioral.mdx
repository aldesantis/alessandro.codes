Marketers like to think of loyalty as a deep, emotional connection that’s formed between a consumer and a brand. However, the data doesn’t seem to support this theory: according to research done by Byron Sharp, 72% of Coke drinkers also drink Pepsi, and 89% of brand users don’t think their brand differs from competitors.

In reality, it looks like loyalty is _very_ often (though not always) just a mix of habit, convenience, satisfaction, and availability: a customer likes your product, or they’re used to your product, or they find your product to be readily available. Hence, they buy it more often.

If this is true, then it means that [[market-penetration-trumps-market-segmentation|Market penetration trumps market segmentation]], because the bond between your brand and your customers is not as deep as you thought, and you can market to a larger customer base.

It also frees up marketers to focus on [[marketing-must-build-availability|building availability]], rather than attempting to create “emotional resonance” or “cultural impact.”

## Counterfactuals

- This flies in the face of most marketing literature, especially in the luxury segment. It would be interesting to explore some counterarguments.
