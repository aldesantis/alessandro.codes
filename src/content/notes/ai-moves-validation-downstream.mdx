When the cost of production is high, validation needs to happen at the planning stage; when the cost of production is low, it’s easier to just produce whatever thing needs to be tested (software, copy, creative, etc.) and see how it performs in the wild.

By lowering the cost of production, generative AI is allowing us to move validation downstream. In other words, we’re relying [[the-map-is-not-the-territory|less on the map and more on the territory]].

This is similar to how, in an ideal world, we would not have a screening process for candidates. We would just hire them and see how they perform in the real world. This is not feasible, so we need to approximate that evaluation; but we should be mindful that it’s just that—an approximation.

This goes partially contrary to the idea that [[efficiency-is-not-effectiveness|efficiency is not effectiveness]] or, as they typically say, “you don’t just need to move fast: you need to move fast in the right direction.” It turns out that moving fast is a way to accelerate finding the right direction (although a balance is necessary).
