You shouldnâ€™t approach all sales channels in the same way. Instead, you should focus on the incremental value that each channel can bring to your brand (e.g., [[wholesale-is-for-breadth-dtc-is-for-depth|Wholesale is for breadth, DTC is for depth]]).

In doing this, keep in mind that being in a sales channels can have hard-to-foresee secondary effects: for example, [[wholesale-boosts-brand-awareness|wholesale boosts brand awareness]], which in turn can increase direct-to-consumer revenue. This is also why [[sales-channels-must-be-integrated|sales channels must be integrated]] rather than adopted in isolation.
