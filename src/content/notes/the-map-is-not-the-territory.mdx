title: The map is not the territory

The real world is much more complex than the mental models we create of it: maps are a necessary simplification so that we can reduce a [[chaotic-systems-are-not-random|chaotic system]] to a number of reproducible, rigid rules, so that the system itself is easier to work with.

When we do this consciously, itâ€™s not a problem necessarily. When we do it unconsciously, we risk generating [[be-wary-of-flawless-ideas|"flawless" ideas]], which have several negative consequences on the quality of our decision-making.
