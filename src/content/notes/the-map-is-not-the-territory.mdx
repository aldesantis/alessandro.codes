title: The map is not the territory

The real world is much more complex than the mental models we create of it: maps are a necessary simplification so that we can reduce a [[chaotic-systems-are-not-random|chaotic system]] to a number of reproducible, rigid rules, so that the system itself is easier to work with.

In other words, while the territory is a fact, the map is a story—it’s important [[stories-are-not-facts|to keep the distinction in mind.]]

When we consciously conflate map and territory, it’s not a problem: as stated before, it’s a necessary mechanism to work and reason within a complex system.

However, when we do it unconsciously, we risk generating [[be-wary-of-flawless-ideas|"flawless" ideas]], which negatively affect the quality of our decision-making.
