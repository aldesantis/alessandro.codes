- I haven’t been consistent with publishing these updates over the last couple of months, and the main reason is that I’ve been working like crazy.
- I also got Covid in June while travelling to Canada, which didn’t help. Threw off my running times (heat also played a part) and left me with a lingering sense that something isn’t quite as it was before.
- On the upside:
	- I’ve been writing some software in my spare time, which I hadn’t done in a long time (except for this website). I had forgotten how much I liked the predictability of software development.
	- After an initial burst of progress on my AI journey, it felt like I was mostly stuck, waiting for the next breakthrough—something that was well articulated by Philipp Schmid in his article about [context engineering](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering). We’ve been running some experiments at Nebulab and it finally feels like we may have made a breakthrough, but it’s a bit early to reveal our secrets.

## What I’m…

- **Reading:**
	- For work: [Agile Estimating and Planning](https://www.amazon.com/Agile-Estimating-Planning-Mike-Cohn/dp/0131479415). I’ve been practicing Agile in one form or another for the past decade, but I always felt like my mental model of Agile estimation lacked coherence/completeness. I hope this will solve it.
	- For fun: [the M series](https://www.amazon.com/M-Century-Novel-Antonio-Scurati/dp/0062956116) by Antonio Scurati, a complete and historically accurate account of Italian fascism. Highly, highly recommended.
- **Listening:**
	- Mostly [From Zero](https://music.apple.com/album/from-zero/1766137049), Linkin Park’s first album with Emily Armstrong after Chester’s suicide in 2017. A part of me hoped I wouldn’t like it, but it turns out I do. Looking forward to the next releases.
- **Watching:**
	- Season 4 of [The Bear](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14452776/), finally! If you like cooking and you like Jeremy Allen White (and who doesn’t?!), you’ll love this.
- **Cooking:**
	- I’m in my smash burger season.
