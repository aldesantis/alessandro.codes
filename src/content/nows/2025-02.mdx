- The Astro rewrite of this website continues, and I’m utterly in love with the framework. It’s an elegant, refreshing way of building for the modern Web without going insane.
- I’ve also been playing with using AI to “write from abundance,” a concept [well explained by David Perell](https://perell.com/essay/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online/) in Write of Passage (highly recommended!). It’s still early stage, but so far I’ve managed to put together a couple of promising prototypes with Pinecone and Weaviate. I may write an essay about it soon!
