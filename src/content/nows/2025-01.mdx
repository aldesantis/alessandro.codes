- As [[2024-12|planned]], I’ve been [rewriting my personal website](https://v2.alessandro.codes) with Astro, and it’s been a delightful experience. The goal was to merge it with my digital garden to have a single home for my digital presence and offer a richer experience than what’s possible with Obsidian Publish. There’s still a lot of work to do, but it’s coming along well so far!
