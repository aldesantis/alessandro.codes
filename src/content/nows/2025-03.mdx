The sun is finally out in this part of the world! I have a bad habit of forgetting how much I’m going to miss it when winter comes around every year and then being miserable for five or six months. Glad we are, once again, on the other side of that tunnel.

Coincidentally, spring also coincides with the start of event season for me, with conferences, dinners, and other various gatherings around the world.

I have a love-hate relationship with professional events. Being away from home is always heartbreaking, but I also realized that I need some level of social bonding in my professional life lest I get dissociated from the work. Balance is key, I guess?

In addition to events, I’ve been lucky enough to get back into consulting for a few of our own clients at [Nebulab](https://nebulab.com). For the last couple of years, I have mostly been detached from service delivery, but we’re now experimenting with some new services/practices that require direct partner oversight. (More on that soon.)

This made me realize that I am much happier and more effective when I’m not just talking/thinking about the work, but also doing it. In fact, I think the whole idea of founders _having_ to scale themselves might be a bit overrated. In the broader startup industry, people have been talking a lot about “founder mode,” so this feels like a timely transition, if nothing else.

Getting back into the game also led to a few reflections, such as:

- [[consulting-involves-tension|Consulting involves tension]]
- [[consulting-is-conversation|Consulting is conversation]]
- [[consulting-maximizes-diversity|Consulting maximizes diversity]]

## In other news

- I kinda fell off the workout wagon (thanks in no small part to professional events), so I’ve been getting back in the game. I’m also trying to incorporate more strength training, even though I don’t enjoy it nearly as much as running.
- I’ve been putting some more work into this website. At this point, Cursor Agent is the only reason I can still make meaningful progress despite having so little time to dedicate to it. I don’t know how we got anything done before Cursor.
- Lately, I’ve been wanting to reconnect with my Polish roots more and more. There’s a simplicity I remember from my time in Poland that I am longing for more, nowadays. Cloe and I agreed to try to squeeze in a quick trip this summer.

## What I am…

- **Cooking:** Cloe and I love Indian food, but I’ve always been intimidated by its richness. I took the plunge a few weeks ago, and I’m finding it surprisingly easy/fault-tolerant. Nothing quite like making your own _naan_ at home.
- **Watching:**
	- If you’re not watching Severance, what are you doing?
	- Cloe and I have also been busy with a Game of Thrones rewatch.
	- Finally, [this show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.W.A.T._(2017_TV_series)) has been my guilty pleasure for the last couple of months. The production is surprisingly good, the dialogues comically bad—I love it.
- **Reading:** [[il-conte-di-montecristo|The Count of Monte Cristo]], mostly. Surprisingly light reading, given the length, and beautifully written.
- **Listening:** Not much nowadays, to be honest. Some Sia, some Bob Dylan, some more random stuff with no discernible pattern.
