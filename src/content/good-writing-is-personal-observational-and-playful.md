# Good writing is personal, observational, and playful

The best pieces of writing have three traits in common. They are:

- **Personal:** it tells stories about your life.
- **Observational:** it has a distinct point of view.
- **Playful:** itâ€™s not afraid to play with ideas (also see, [[weirdness-is-the-seed-of-humor|Weirdness is the seed of humor]]).
