  - name: Estasi e sofferenza
    slug: estasi-e-sofferenza
    description: >
      A short novel about the relationship between <em>Eros</em> and <em>Thanatos</em>,
      love and death, so apparently far apart and yet so hopelessly intertwined.
      <em>Estasi e sofferenza</em> is a story about the lengths we can go for those we
      want in our lives and how, very often, what <em>is</em> and what <em>appears</em>
      are two different things.
  - name: La società alternativa
    slug: la-societa-alternativa
    description: >
      We've all dreamt of a better world at least once, whether out of genuine love for
      our species or mere boredom – a world where man would be free from the burdens of
      ordinary life. What if we found that world is well within our reach?
      <em>La società alternativa</em> is a reminder of how easily our deepest dreams
      are molded.
  - name: L'ultimo guerriero
    slug: ultimo-guerriero
    description: >
      My very first (finished) production, this is a story of belonging, jealousy and
      motherhood. Sometimes, we can find ourselves in the least expected of places – but
      what happens when someone strips us of our new-found identity and throws us back
      into the numbness of that world we tried to escape?
  - name: Specismo e benessere animale
    slug: specismo-e-benessere-animale
    description: >
      What remains of my year-long dive into the world of specism and animal welfare,
      <em>Specismo e benessere animale</em> is a reflection on the current state of
      animal testing and its alternative, exploring the ideas of several different
      philosophers and evaluating the moral weight of using animals for our preservation.
  - name: Riflessioni semiserie
    slug: riflessioni-semiserie
    description: >
      A short collection of reflections on different topics: God, religion, the great
      paradoxes of philosophy and atheism and a few other matters. This is my brain
      dump, constantly updated with my latest findings and conclusions. It serves as a
      reminder of the volatility of thoughts and opinions.

  - name: Charlotte
    slug: charlotte
    description: >
      Once again, a study of human relationships. We think love is above everything, but
      is it, really? By telling the most scandalous of affairs, <em>Charlotte</em>
      pushes the limits of our moral principles and forces us to reconsider our own
      concepts of right and wrong or, if you prefer, of love and deviation.
    wip: true
  - name: La via
    slug: la-via
    description: >
      A dystopian novel, inspired by George Orwell's <em>1984</em> and P. D. James'
      <em>The Children of Men</em>. A story about discrimination and our most visceral
      fears, but also a story about courage and how it's sometimes shown by those who
      have everything to lose.
    wip: true
  - name: La cittadella
    slug: la-cittadella
    description: >
      A sequel to <em>La società alternativa</em>, this is a new look at the intricacy
      of human desires, trying to shed light on the contradictions which make us human.
      When we hate what we once loved so badly, there are few people we can turn to.
